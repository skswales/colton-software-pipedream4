and Errata</a> for details of changes to functionality.</p>


<h4>4.58 (29 Jul 2020)</h4>

<p>Spreadsheet functions can now accept text strings longer than 200
characters as input, and create long text strings as results.</p>

<p>The DAYNAME() and WEEKDAY() spreadsheet functions may now take a mode
parameter to control the calculation (as Fireworkz).</p>

<p>The REPLACE() spreadsheet functions no longer accepts zero for the
<em>start_n</em> parameter (interface is one-based; using zero could
have given unpredictable results).</p>

<p>The first button to the ALERT() and INPUT() spreadsheet functions is mandatory;
if it is empty, the button is labelled "OK".</p>

<p>The second button to the ALERT() and INPUT() spreadsheet functions is optional;
if it is present, but empty, the button is labelled "Cancel".</p>

<p><strong>Complex number spreadsheet function added:</strong></p>

<p>C_ROUND(complex number {, decimal places})</p>

<p>This can be particularly useful in conjunction with complex number strings.</p>

<p>Complex number functions now accept OpenDocument / Microsoft Excel-style
complex number strings (e.g. "2+1i", "1", "-j") as well as 2x1 arrays of
numbers. The acceptable imaginary numbers suffix is either lower-case i or
j, and where a function takes a pair of complex numbers and an imaginary
number suffix is specified on both numbers, both numbers need not use the
same suffix (this is the same as Fireworkz, whereas Microsoft Excel would
require both to be the same) and 'i' will dominate.</p>

<p>The C library's complex number functions are used where possible in the
complex number spreadsheet functions rather than our own implementation of
these.</p>

<p>Financial function HTML help added.</p>

<p>Colour picker windows opened from the Chart Selection menu
now open in the correct position.
Redundant copy of colour selection code removed.</p>

<p>Insert colour dialogue box now has the correct title.</p>

<p>Names of new documents are now based on the name of the template
from which they were created.</p>

<p>HTML help now provides links to the PipeDream-Manuals for use when they
are installed.</p>

<p>The HTML help files (and supporting image files) within !PipeDream
and in the Getting Started section of the Manuals package have been renamed
to ten characters or fewer to allow correct installation and usage on
older systems with no long filename support and without truncation enabled.
Files in the Reference Guide have been renamed so as to be unique within
their first ten characters, so allowing them to be installed and used on
older systems so long as truncation is enabled.</p>

<p>PipeDream gives an error for ADJUST-click on toolbar buttons where that is not appropriate.</p>

<p>The <code>End</code> key is no longer referred to as the <code>Copy</code> key.</p>

<p>Added Microsoft Word / OpenOffice-compatible keyboard shortcuts Ctrl-L,E,R for Left,Centre,Right Align.</p>

<p>PipeDream sets up some more keyboard shortcuts suggested by the
Style Guide when in non-Classic mode:<br>
Ctrl-Z == Clear markers;<br>
Ctrl-X == Delete block (to paste list);<br>
Ctrl-C == Copy block to paste list.<br>
It also sets up some keyboard shortcuts which were unintentionally
left unmapped in non-Classic mode:<br>
Shift-left arrow == Previous word;<br>
Shift-right arrow == Next word;<br>
Shift-up arrow == Page up;<br>
Shift-down arrow == Page down;<br>
Ctrl-left arrow == Start of cell;<br>
Ctrl-right arrow == End of cell;<br>
Ctrl-up arrow == Top of column;<br>
Ctrl-down arrow == Bottom of column;
</p>

<p>PipeDream dialogue box buttons are now somewhat more Style Guide compliant.</p>

<p>The standard File &gt; Save dialogue box is now Style Guide compliant and less daunting.
The full File > Save dialogue box is still available from the menu.</p>

<p>!RunImage has been reduced in size by about 10% by stripping C function names.</p>

<p>PipeDream will start up using about 150KB less memory than 4.57.</p>

<p>Updated copy of RISC_OSLib used to avoid (rare) zero page accesses.</p>

<p>IconSprites !SpritesR4 on RISC OS 3, 4 and 6 (alternate pin position).</p>

<p>
  Application resources have restructured within !PipeDream.
  PipeDream$Path is set appropriately by the Loader.
  It is used to locate vital resources needed to run PipeDream e.g. messages, sprites and window templates,
  to locate most data presented by PipeDream to the user e.g. chart markers, master dictionary, printer drivers
  and also the user's data e.g. Choices, Key, command files, user dictionaries etc.
  If &lt;PipeDream$UserPath&gt; is set, this is set as the first path element.
  PipeDream$TemplatesPath is also set appropriately by the Loader - it does not contain fallback locations.
  See the Paths page in the <em>Reference Guide</em>.
</p>

<p>PipeDream uses an external Obey file, ImgConvert,
to invoke ChangeFSI to convert image files to sprites.
By doing so, it can give more helpful warnings and
avoid inadvertently leaving a large Next wimp slot.</p>

<p>If a Lotus 1-2-3 file is dragged to the PipeDream icon,
PipeDream will check whether the !123PD utility is available.
If so, PipeDream will invoke it automatically to convert
a copy of the file to PipeDream format and load that.</p>

<p>The PipeDream to/from Lotus 1-2-3 file converters now
set the correct RISC OS file type on the converted file.</p>

<p>ROOL DDE 29c build environment used.</p>


<h4>4.57.01 (21 Mar 2020)</h4>

<p>!RunImage is squeezed for faster loading from slow devices.</p>

<p>Improved packaging giving homepage and indicating compatibility.</p>


<h4>4.57 (20 Dec 2019)</h4>

<h4>Mathematical spreadsheet functions added:</h4>

<p>
    BASE(),
    DECIMAL().
</p>

<p>The DDB() spreadsheet function may now use a non-integer period for
calculation.</p>

<p>Formatting a very large number with a small radix using the TEXT()
spreadsheet function no longer overflows the temporary buffer causing
subsequent error.</p>

<p>Checks for integer overflow when adding to/subtracting from date/time
components.</p>

<p>Checks for attempt to divide by a denormalised (i.e. very very small)
number; this would previously have given FP error rather than Divide by zero
error.</p>

<p>PipeDream accepts dates entered in ISO 8601 date format (or as dd/mm/yy)
when either typed or imported from CSV.</p>

<p>Note: PipeDream allows single digits in dates when checking against the
ISO 8601 date format, where two digits are strictly required in the month
and day components, for compatibility with some CSV files from odd sources
(banking data). </p>

<p>PipeDream chart files now use a newly allocated file type, &amp;A77
(PDChart). This can help other applications identify PipeDream chart files
as trivially renderable using the Drawfile module. A Draw tag from the newly
allocated Colton Software vendor range is used to identify the block of
PipeDream instructions used to generate the chart. Chart files are now
padded at the end to a multiple of four bytes with the digit zero rather
than space.</p>

<p>Note: PipeDream will continue to attempt to load previously saved chart
files of file type &amp;DDE (PDream) as before, although they will be
immediately re-saved with the new file type and use the new Draw tag unless
Choices &gt; 'New chart files' is unticked.</p>

<p>Some missing spreadsheet function documentation added.</p>

<p>ROOL DDE 29a build environment used.</p>


<h4>4.56.02 (19 Mar 2019)</h4>

<p>Fix CHOOSE() when used with range or array parameters.
This had been broken since 4.52/04.</p>

<p>ROOL DDE 28 build environment used.</p>


<h4>4.56.01 (21 Dec 2018)</h4>

<p>Define Function Key option list reverted to pre-4.56 for compatibility.</p>


<h4>4.56 (17 Dec 2018)</h4>

<p>PipeDream menus and keyboard shortcuts are now a little more Style Guide
compliant. Existing users may wish to head to the iconbar menu and turn on
'Classic menus' and 'Save Choices'.</p>

<p>Fixed chart text object editing bug.</p>

<p>Fixed chart loading bug introduced in 4.50/45.</p>

<p>Fixed spreadsheet range recognition code so that the end cell reference
of a range of cells is correctly updated when it is used to define a name.
This had been broken since 4.55.00.</p>

<p>Updated spreadsheet cell reference recognition code to accept a leading
percent to indicate 'Bad reference'. This is needed as saved documents with
such bad references (e.g. when the referenced cell has been deleted) would
otherwise fail to load correctly.</p>

<p>Fixed subtraction code: subtracting extremely large numbers of
individually small integers could have eventually given an undetected
integer overflow.</p>

<p>Fixed execution of command files from the Do command file dialogue box.</p>

<p>Speed-up for M_DETERM() and M_INVERSE() for large sparse matrices.</p>

<p>DDB() spreadsheet function accepts an extra parameter, factor (optional).
The default is 2.0.</p>

<p>INDEX() spreadsheet function will now accept zero for the column and/or row number.<br />
If the column number is zero, the whole of the specified row(s) is returned.<br />
If the row number is zero, the whole of the specified column(s) is returned.</p>
<p>INDEX() spreadsheet function will now accept zero for the optional column and/or row size.<br />
If the column size is zero, the rest of the specified row(s) beginning at the given column number is returned.<br />
If the row size is zero, the whole of the specified column(s) beginning at the given row number is returned.</p>

<p>SERIESSUM() spreadsheet function has been backported from Fireworkz.
An example of its use is given in the PipeDream Examples package.</p>

<p>Text @-field handling enhanced to allow colour and font change
information contained in refrerenced cells to be inserted into the
referencing cell's output when @<em>cell_reference</em>@ is used and a
global font is in use.</p>

<p>Text @-field handling enhanced to allow use of HTML format colour
strings: @C:#<em>rrggbb</em>@, @C:rgb(<em>r,g,b</em>)@,
@C:<em>html_colour_name</em>@.</p>

<p>Text @-field handling enhanced to allow use of format strings with date,
time and page number fields: @D:<em>date_format</em>@,
@N:<em>time_format</em>@ and @P:<em>number_format</em>@. @D@, @N@ and @P@
without format strings give the same results as before.The format strings
are those used by the TEXT() spreadsheet function.</p>

<p>Examples:<br />
@D:yyyy-mm-dd@ displays the current date in ISO 8601 format,<br />
@T:hh:mm@ displays the current time without seconds,<br />
@P:r#@ displays page numbers as lower-case Roman numerals.</p>

<p>Note that both current date and time components are passed to @D@ and @N@
to enable a composite date with time string to be displayed. Example:
@D:yyyy-mm-dd\Thh:mm:ss@ displays an ISO 8601 date/time.</p>

<p>Typing a text-@ character or clicking on a highlight Toolbar button (e.g.
Bold) enters the data as text when the caret is in an empty cell regardless
of the New cell format option.</p>

<p>Insert colour command (\EITC) added to the Edit menu. This command allows
the user to choose a colour using the ColourPicker module and inserts the
corresponding @C:<em>r,g,b</em>@ sequence.</p>

<p>Insert date (\EITD), time (\EITN) and page number (\EITP) commands added
to the Edit menu. These commands allow the user to choose an appropriate
format string and insert the corresponding text-@ sequence with the chosen
format string.</p>

<p>Chart Fill Style dialogue box now works in >16 colour modes and centres
Markers / Pictures in the icon.</p>

<p>Insert option on Choices menu replaced by Overtype option for clarity.</p>

<p>Replicate command restored to short menus.</p>

<p>Replicate Left (\BRL) and Replicate Up (\BRU) commands implemented and
added to long menus. These may also be accessed by clicking Adjust on the
Replicate Right and Replicate Down buttons respectively.</p>

<p>Fixed running a PipeDream command file when PipeDream is not running.
This had been broken since 4.52.00.</p>

<p>When running on a version of RISC OS where clicking in the Filer causes
the Filer to acquire the input focus, double-clicking a PipeDream Command
file in the Filer will execute that command file in the context of the
document that had the input focus before it was acquired by the Filer.</p>

<p>Record command file will once again create command files in the same
directory as the current document. If the current document has not been
saved, it will create the command file in
&lt;Choices$Write&gt;.PipeDream.CmdFiles.</p>

<p>Do command file will now list any command files found in the same
directory as the current document (and in any subdirectory CmdFiles thereof)
in addition to those found on the path.</p>

<p>Dump dictionary and Merge dictionary processing enormously speeded up on
newer systems.</p>

<p>Colour handling has been improved to allow selection of arbitrary colours
for each PipeDream display element using the ColourPicker module. Previously
such selection was restricted to the Window Manager 16-colour palette. Where
a newly selected colour exactly matches that in the Window Manager 16-colour
palette, its palette index is displayed, otherwise the corresponding HTML
colour code #RRGGBB is displayed.</p>

<p>The PipeDream colour constructs have been extended to store new colours
and now take the extended form: %OP%C&lt;c&gt;,&lt;index&gt;{,0xBBGGRR00}
(the hexadecimal colour parameter is omitted for exactly matching
colours).</p>

<p>English date format relabelled as D.M.Y in the Options dialogue box
and referred to as British-style in documentation.
American date format similarly relabelled as M.D.Y</p>

<p>The Load file dialogue box is now only created as a RISC OS submenu if it
is invoked by traversing the RISC OS menu structure using the arrow at the
right of the Load menu option. If the Load file dialogue box is invoked by
clicking on the Load menu option, from a command sequence (^FL) or a
user-defined mapped keystroke, it is opened as a standalone dialogue box.
This allows the user to then find a directory viewer containing files to be
loaded without the dialogue box collapsing. A file may then be dragged into
the Load file dialogue box, filling the file name field, and options
relevant to loading that file selected. To cancel the dialogue box, press
ESCAPE or click the Cancel button. Note that no other PipeDream dialogue
boxes can be invoked whilst the Load dialogue box is being shown as a
standalone dialogue box.</p>

<p>Save/Discard/Cancel and Yes/No dialogue boxes have been cosmetically
improved by splitting the message that was output into a (possibly quite
long) statement followed by a shorter discrete question.</p>

<p>A Web button (and a PipeDream logo) has been added to the About this
program dialogue box. This uses the PipeDream$Web variable set by !Run.</p>

<p>Window Manager flags bit is set to save and restore FP state over SWI
Wimp_Poll and Wimp_PollIdle calls rather than doing it manually.</p>

<p>The PipeDream application and file icons have been smartened up to better
match the actual PipeDream 4 logo artwork.</p>

<p>180 DPI application and file icons supplied in RISC OS 5 style.</p>

<p>Toolbar icons appearance improved and 180 DPI toolbar icons supplied;
some toolbar icons are now derived from the public domain Tango Icon
Library.</p>

<p>Toolbar is slightly less tall, leaving some more room for data.</p>

<p>Mark document/Clear selection Toolbar button added, replacing the box to
the left of the column headings.</p>

<p>Using one of the highlight Toolbar buttons with a marked block now
redraws correctly. Additionally, the corresponding option is set in the
Remove highlights dialogue box in case you wish to remove the highlights
thus set.</p>

<p>Clicking Adjust on the Left justify Toolbar button will restore the
default justification on the marked block (or current cell).</p>

<p>Clicking Adjust on the Decimal places Toolbar button will restore the
default format on the marked block (or current cell).</p>

<p>Clicking Adjust on Toolbar buttons with no alternate function defined
will no longer execute the standard function used when Select is
clicked.</p>

<p>Formula Editing Window buttons more consistent with Toolbar buttons.</p>

<p>Copy/Cut/Paste buttons added to Formula Editing Window.</p>

<p>Clicking Adjust on the Tick button transfers the formula line contents to
the Formula Editing Window.</p>

<p>Multi-line formula editing (and chart text) window only uses fonts if a
Desktop font is in use.</p>

<p>Unintentional zero page access when loading blank file name fixed.</p>

<p>Top level Help menu entry added.</p>

<p>Interactive Help messages are now given for the Formula Editing Window
buttons.</p>

<p>Interactive Help messages are now more consistent with the RISC OS Style
Guide recommendations and use Help tokens where possible.</p>

<p>Writeable icons in Spell Create/Open/Pack user dictionary dialogue boxes
use RISC OS Style Guide compliant appearance and size.</p>

<p>Menus are no longer padded to a fixed field width with spaces.</p>

<p>
    Application resources moved from !PipeDream.Resource. to !PipeDream.AppData.
    Language-specific resources (Dictionaries, Dictionary Definition Files, Document Templates, PipeDream Printer Drivers)
    are located in a sub-directory of AppData.
    The only one currently provided fully populated is UK.
    The Deutsch DictDefn file is provided in the Germany directory.
    Language-neutral resources (Markers, Pictures) may be found in the Neutral sub-directory of AppData.
    PipeDream$Path is set by !Boot and !Run and is used to locate these resources.
</p>

<p>
    RISC OS-type resources are now located in !PipeDream.Resources.
    (They had previously been separated out of the Resource directory into a RISC_OS sub-directory).
    Language-specific RISC OS-type resources (Help, Messages, Sprites, Window Templates) are located in a sub-directory of Resources.
    The only one currently provided is UK.
    Themed variants of the Sprites, e.g. iMX6, can be loaded on RISC OS 5 if provided by the user (controlled by Wimp$IconTheme).
    Language-neutral RISC OS-type resources (!Sprite, ImageSlot, Loader) may be found in the Neutral sub-directory of AppData.
    A new variable, PipeDreamRes$Path, is set by !Run and is used to locate these resources.
</p>

<p>
    Resources.UK.Help.HTML is a directory containing helpful info and supersedes the old HTMLHelp file.
    It now contains Command Reference, Spreadsheet Functions and Toolbar information.
</p>

<p>Internal error handler improved to show Continue and Quit button pair with more logical outcomes.</p>

<p>Stack overflow handler fixed - no longer gives 'Uncaught trap'.</p>

<p>Release notes are now located at top level in !PipeDream.</p>

<p>ROOL DDE 27 build environment used.</p>


<h4>4.55.04 (01 Aug 2016)</h4>

<p>CODE() spreadsheet function extended to accept empty string as input (in
which case it returns zero).</p>

<p>Custom function debugging assisted by outputting errors encountered as
<code>ERROR_CUSTOM: [<em>cf_doc_name</em>] Row <em>N</em> Error <em>String</em> </code>
to Reporter module if it is loaded and enabled.</p>


<h4>4.55.03 (27 Jul 2016)</h4>

<p>Choosing a spreadsheet function from the function selector menu enters
the formula editing line when clicked on an empty cell regardless of the New
cell format option.</p>

<p>The Copyright file in the PipeDream package explicitly includes a copy of
the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.</p>


<h4>4.55.02 (12 Jul 2016)</h4>

<p>Formula editing window (obtained by pressing Ctrl-Return in the formula
line) uses DejaVuSans.Mono if it is available AND a Unicode Font Manager is
in use.</p>

<p>Showing cell / range / name values from function menu puts a colon suffix
after the cell reference / range / name.</p>

<p>Function menu now allows cell / range values to be evaluated in custom
function sheets again. This had been deliberately disabled in 4.52/06 but
there can be a real use for this when debugging custom function sheets!</p>

<p>Correctly accumulates spaces between symbols when compiling formula for
number cell. This had been broken since 4.52/08 when leading equals sign was
first allowed. Trailing spaces before an internal newline are omitted.</p>


<h4>4.55.01 (03 Jul 2016)</h4>

<p>Check overwrite file dialogue box will take priority over any possibly
persisting Save dialogue box.</p>


<h4>4.55 (21 May 2016)</h4>

<p>PipeDream chart files are now PRM-conformant Draw files and can be loaded
by Draw, Vector and Fireworkz when the file type is set to Draw. They can
still be loaded by previous versions of PipeDream.</p>

<p>Image file loader updated to handle Vector files.</p>

<p>Image file loader updated to handle sprites with mode selectors.</p>

<p>Image file loader updated to better handle JPEGs.</p>

<p>Uses ChangeFSI, if available, to convert a much wider range of image file
formats. On machines where the OS is not shadowed in RAM, you can improve
ChangeFSI's performance by first typing '*RMFaster BASIC'.</p>

<p>Scrap files for image conversion are created in the
&lt;Wimp$ScrapDir&gt;.PipeDream directory.</p>

<p>Fixed potential error leak in LINEST().</p>

<p>Fixed URLs in notes for new CMS.</p>

<p>Coloured tick and cross for accept / cancel buttons of formula line.</p>

<p>Document file sprites have turned-up bottom right corner.</p>

<p>Fixed long-standing spell check dictionary creation / packing
exception.</p>

<p>Dropped support for ancient 'Integrale' format spell check dictionaries
which required ODctDefn.</p>

<p>Updated Master dictionary with many new words (from SCOWL). The Master
dictionary that now ships with PipeDream contains words with -<em>ise</em>
style endings which are common in written British English. A Master
dictionary containing words with -<em>ize</em> style endings (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling">Oxford English
Dictionary spelling</a>) may be obtained from the web site and substituted
for that shipped with PipeDream. The old PipeDream dictionary containing
both -<em>ise</em> and -<em>ize</em> style endings may also be obtained from
the web site.</p>


<h4>Previous versions</h4> <p>The full release history may be found <a
href="http://croftnuisk.co.uk/coltsoft/pipedream/release_history">online</a>;
just the last few revisions of PipeDream are documented here.</p>


<h2 id="KnownProblems">Known Problems In This Release</h2>

<p>It is still possible (and has been since PipeDream 3) to create circular
dependencies in @slot_ref@ chains which fail to complete calculation.</p>

<p>Pressing ESCAPE whilst dragging a file somewhere to be saved may
sometimes cause a Data Abort.</p>

<p>There is a problem whereby a document does not reload a newly created
chart properly. If an chart is created and a copy of the chart is saved out
as a Draw file (with a different name) then the chart will not reload after
being closed down. It will reload successfully if PipeDream is
restarted.</p>

<p>Exporting charts directly to other applications (e.g. EasyWriter) as Draw
files via the Message_RAMFetch / Message_RAMTransfer mechanism only works if
the application being exported to asks for the whole file in one go as the
protocol is stopped by PipeDream after the first Message_RAMFetch is
responded to.</p>


<h2>32-bit !System</h2>

<p>Please note that the latest distribution of !System for use with
pre-RISC OS 5 computers may be found on the RISC OS Open web site at:<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<a
href="https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/other-zipfiles">https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/other-zipfiles</a><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
under the heading: <strong>System resources</strong></p>

<p>NB Do NOT use the standard merge dialogue in
!Boot &gt; Configuration &gt; System Merge</p>

<p>because part of the update must refresh files in a directory that the
merge dialogue cannot reach.</p>

<p>Instead, a simple Obey file is included called !SysMerge.
Just double click on !SysMerge.</p>
