and Errata</a> for details of changes to functionality.</p>


<h4>4.60 (22 Jul 2022)</h4>

<p>PipeDream can import tab-separated-value files of type TSV
(&amp;F0D).</p>

<p>The international currency symbol (&curren;: &amp;A4) can be used in the
leading (or trailing - but not in both) characters definition string, where
it is substituted during rendering with the appropriate currency string read
from the Territory Manager (e.g. &pound; in the UK).</p>

<p>The default leading characters string is now &curren; rather than &pound;.</p>

<p>An empty default locale is set during startup so that the system default
locale is used wherever possible by the SharedCLibrary functions, using the
Territory Manager. This may be overridden by editing
 <code>!PipeDream.!Run</code> and adding
 <code>-l &lt;locale-specifier&gt;</code> to the PipeDream command line.</p>

<p>Pressing Ctrl whilst clicking the Up icon in dialogue boxes may be used
to set the value in the adjacent field to its maximum allowed value (or to
the start of the list of values). Similarly, Ctrl-Down may be used to set
the minimum allowed value (or to the end of the list of values).</p>

<p>Numbers typed in the formula line (or imported from CSV files) with only
trailing zeros immediately behind the decimal point (e.g. 1.0) are no longer
immediately converted to integers for subsequent calculation, display or
saving but now remain as floating point values (with zero fractional
part).</p>

<p>Interactive Help messages more consistent between row and column
borders.</p>

<p><code>SWI Portable_Idle</code> is called during pausing when printing to
screen.</p>

<p>More consistent use of https:// vs. http:// in URLs.</p>

<p>ROOL DDE 30d build environment used.</p>


<h4>4.59.01 (01 Oct 2021)</h4>

<p>Much faster M_DETERM() and M_INVERSE() with large matrices.</p>

<p>No longer sets the alias for printing PDChart files when dragged to a
printer icon - these files cannot be printed that way.</p>

<p>Updated ImageSlot transient utility has RISC OS 4/6 header and Aemulor
32OK trailing bytes.</p>


<h4>4.59 (06 Sep 2021)</h4>

<p>PipeDream can now be set up to be the default handler for any file type
that it can import. See the !Boot file for details.</p>

<p>ROOL DDE 30b build environment used.</p>


<h4>4.58.03 (31 Jan 2021)</h4>

<p>Fixed printing of negative numbers in red to a colour printer.</p>


<h4>4.58.02 (27 Sep 2020)</h4>

<p>Fixed the WEEKDAY() spreadsheet function - it could hang PipeDream.</p>


<h4>4.58.01 (24 Sep 2020)</h4>

<p>Fixed Zero Page access during Null events prior to any spreadsheet having
been loaded.</p>

<p>Fixed issue where clicking Adjust on the formula editing line would give
an inappropriate error.</p>

<p>Changed the icon type of the formula editing line to Writable (from
Writable/Drag) so that the Window Manager selection processing code is
enabled on newer OSes. Text may be copied to or from the formula editing
line via the global clipboard.</p>

<p>Standard selection processing keyboard shortcuts added to the formula
editing window (see its menu) and the Chart text editing window. These also
use Home and End as text navigation keys and Delete deletes the character to
the left of the caret as in the formula editing line.</p>

<p>Copy/Cut/Paste buttons added to Chart text editing window.</p>

<p>Document template files all made slightly wider so that all the initial
columns are shown fully.</p>


<h4>4.58 (29 Jul 2020)</h4>

<p>Spreadsheet functions can now accept text strings longer than 200
characters as input, and create long text strings as results.</p>

<p>The DAYNAME() and WEEKDAY() spreadsheet functions may now take a mode
parameter to control the calculation (as Fireworkz).</p>

<p>The REPLACE() spreadsheet functions no longer accepts zero for the
<em>start_n</em> parameter (interface is one-based; using zero could
have given unpredictable results).</p>

<p>The first button to the ALERT() and INPUT() spreadsheet functions is mandatory;
if it is empty, the button is labelled "OK".</p>

<p>The second button to the ALERT() and INPUT() spreadsheet functions is optional;
if it is present, but empty, the button is labelled "Cancel".</p>

<p><strong>Complex number spreadsheet function added:</strong></p>

<p>C_ROUND(complex number {, decimal places})</p>

<p>This can be particularly useful in conjunction with complex number strings.</p>

<p>Complex number functions now accept OpenDocument / Microsoft Excel-style
complex number strings (e.g. "2+1i", "1", "-j") as well as 2x1 arrays of
numbers. The acceptable imaginary numbers suffix is either lower-case i or
j, and where a function takes a pair of complex numbers and an imaginary
number suffix is specified on both numbers, both numbers need not use the
same suffix (this is the same as Fireworkz, whereas Microsoft Excel would
require both to be the same) and 'i' will dominate.</p>

<p>The C library's complex number functions are used where possible in the
complex number spreadsheet functions rather than our own implementation of
these.</p>

<p>Financial function HTML help added.</p>

<p>Colour picker windows opened from the Chart Selection menu
now open in the correct position.
Redundant copy of colour selection code removed.</p>

<p>Insert colour dialogue box now has the correct title.</p>

<p>Names of new documents are now based on the name of the template
from which they were created.</p>

<p>HTML help now provides links to the PipeDream-Manuals for use when they
are installed.</p>

<p>The HTML help files (and supporting image files) within !PipeDream
and in the Getting Started section of the Manuals package have been renamed
to ten characters or fewer to allow correct installation and usage on
older systems with no long filename support and without truncation enabled.
Files in the Reference Guide have been renamed so as to be unique within
their first ten characters, so allowing them to be installed and used on
older systems so long as truncation is enabled.</p>

<p>PipeDream gives an error for Adjust-click on toolbar buttons where that is not appropriate.</p>

<p>The <code>End</code> key is no longer referred to as the <code>Copy</code> key.</p>

<p>Added Microsoft Word / OpenOffice-compatible keyboard shortcuts Ctrl-L,E,R for Left,Centre,Right Align.</p>

<p>PipeDream sets up some more keyboard shortcuts suggested by the
Style Guide when in non-Classic mode:<br>
Ctrl-Z == Clear markers;<br>
Ctrl-X == Delete block (to paste list);<br>
Ctrl-C == Copy block to paste list.<br>
It also sets up some keyboard shortcuts which were unintentionally
left unmapped in non-Classic mode:<br>
Shift-left arrow == Previous word;<br>
Shift-right arrow == Next word;<br>
Shift-up arrow == Page up;<br>
Shift-down arrow == Page down;<br>
Ctrl-left arrow == Start of cell;<br>
Ctrl-right arrow == End of cell;<br>
Ctrl-up arrow == Top of column;<br>
Ctrl-down arrow == Bottom of column;
</p>

<p>PipeDream dialogue box buttons are now somewhat more Style Guide compliant.</p>

<p>The standard File &gt; Save dialogue box is now Style Guide compliant and less daunting.
The full File &gt; Save dialogue box is still available from the menu.</p>

<p>!RunImage has been reduced in size by about 10% by stripping C function names.</p>

<p>PipeDream will start up using about 150KB less memory than 4.57.</p>

<p>Updated copy of RISC_OSLib used to avoid (rare) zero page accesses.</p>

<p>IconSprites !SpritesR4 on RISC OS 3, 4 and 6 (alternate pin position).</p>

<p>
  Application resources have restructured within !PipeDream.
  PipeDream$Path is set appropriately by the Loader.
  It is used to locate vital resources needed to run PipeDream e.g. messages, sprites and window templates,
  to locate most data presented by PipeDream to the user e.g. chart markers, master dictionary, printer drivers
  and also the user's data e.g. Choices, Key, command files, user dictionaries etc.
  If &lt;PipeDream$UserPath&gt; is set, this is set as the first path element.
  PipeDream$TemplatesPath is also set appropriately by the Loader - it does not contain fallback locations.
  See the Paths page in the <em>Reference Guide</em>.
</p>

<p>PipeDream uses an external Obey file, ImgConvert,
to invoke ChangeFSI to convert image files to sprites.
By doing so, it can give more helpful warnings and
avoid inadvertently leaving a large Next wimp slot.</p>

<p>If a Lotus 1-2-3 file is dragged to the PipeDream icon,
PipeDream will check whether the !123PD utility is available.
If so, PipeDream will invoke it automatically to convert
a copy of the file to PipeDream format and load that.</p>

<p>The PipeDream to/from Lotus 1-2-3 file converters now
set the correct RISC OS file type on the converted file.</p>

<p>ROOL DDE 29c build environment used.</p>


<h2 id="KnownProblems">Known Problems In This Release</h2>

<p>It is still possible (and has been since PipeDream 3) to create circular
dependencies in @cell_ref@ chains which fail to complete calculation.</p>

<p>Pressing ESCAPE whilst dragging a file somewhere to be saved may
sometimes cause a Data Abort.</p>

<p>There is a problem whereby a document does not reload a newly created
chart properly. If an chart is created and a copy of the chart is saved out
as a Draw file (with a different name) then the chart will not reload after
being closed down. It will reload successfully if PipeDream is
restarted.</p>

<p>Exporting charts directly to other applications (e.g. EasyWriter) as Draw
files via the Message_RAMFetch / Message_RAMTransfer mechanism only works if
the application being exported to asks for the whole file in one go as the
protocol is stopped by PipeDream after the first Message_RAMFetch is
responded to.</p>
