<H2 ID="ReleaseHistory">Release History</H2>

<H4>4.56 (17 Dec 2018)</H4>

<p>PipeDream menus and keyboard shortcuts are now a little more Style Guide
compliant. Existing users may wish to head to the iconbar menu and turn on
'Classic menus' and 'Save Choices'.

<p>Fixed chart text object editing bug.</p>

<p>Fixed chart loading bug introduced in 4.50/45.</p>

<p>Fixed spreadsheet range recognition code so that the end cell reference
of a range of cells is correctly updated when it is used to define a name.
This had been broken since 4.55.00.</p>

<p>Updated spreadsheet cell reference recognition code to accept a leading
percent to indicate 'Bad reference'. This is needed as saved documents with
such bad references (e.g. when the referenced cell has been deleted) would
otherwise fail to load correctly.</p>

<p>Fixed subtraction code: subtracting extremely large numbers of
individually small integers could have eventually given an undetected
integer overflow.</p>

<p>Fixed execution of command files from the Do command file dialogue box.</p>

<p>Speed-up for M_DETERM() and M_INVERSE() for large sparse matrices.</p>

<p>DDB() spreadsheet function accepts an extra parameter, factor (optional).
The default is 2.0.</p>

<p>INDEX() spreadsheet function will now accept zero for the column and/or row number.<br />
If the column number is zero, the whole of the specified row(s) is returned.<br />
If the row number is zero, the whole of the specified column(s) is returned.</p>
<p>INDEX() spreadsheet function will now accept zero for the optional column and/or row size.<br />
If the column size is zero, the rest of the specified row(s) beginning at the given column number is returned.<br />
If the row size is zero, the whole of the specified column(s) beginning at the given row number is returned.</p>

<p>SERIESSUM() spreadsheet function has been backported from Fireworkz.
An example of its use is given in the PipeDream Examples package.</p>

<p>Text @-field handling enhanced to allow colour and font change
information contained in refrerenced cells to be inserted into the
referencing cell's output when @<em>cell_reference</em>@ is used and a
global font is in use.</p>

<p>Text @-field handling enhanced to allow use of HTML format colour
strings: @C:#<em>rrggbb</em>@, @C:rgb(<em>r,g,b</em>)@,
@C:<em>html_colour_name</em>@.</p>

<p>Text @-field handling enhanced to allow use of format strings with date,
time and page number fields: @D:<em>date_format</em>@,
@N:<em>time_format</em>@ and @P:<em>number_format</em>@. @D@, @N@ and @P@
without format strings give the same results as before.The format strings
are those used by the TEXT() spreadsheet function.</p>

<p>Examples:<br />
@D:yyyy-mm-dd@ displays the current date in ISO 8601 format,<br />
@T:hh:mm@ displays the current time without seconds,<br />
@P:r#@ displays page numbers as lower-case Roman numerals.</p>

<p>Note that both current date and time components are passed to @D@ and @N@
to enable a composite date with time string to be displayed. Example:
@D:yyyy-mm-dd\Thh:mm:ss@ displays an ISO 8601 date/time.</p>

<p>Typing a text-@ character or clicking on a highlight Toolbar button (e.g.
Bold) enters the data as text when the caret is in an empty cell regardless
of the New cell format option.</p>

<p>Insert colour command (\EITC) added to the Edit menu. This command allows
the user to choose a colour using the ColourPicker module and inserts the
corresponding @C:<em>r,g,b</em>@ sequence.</p>

<p>Insert date (\EITD), time (\EITN) and page number (\EITP) commands added
to the Edit menu. These commands allow the user to choose an appropriate
format string and insert the corresponding text-@ sequence with the chosen
format string.</p>

<p>Chart Fill Style dialogue box now works in >16 colour modes and centres
Markers / Pictures in the icon.</p>

<p>Insert option on Choices menu replaced by Overtype option for clarity.</p>

<p>Replicate command restored to short menus.</p>

<p>Replicate Left (\BRL) and Replicate Up (\BRU) commands implemented and
added to long menus. These may also be accessed by clicking Adjust on the
Replicate Right and Replicate Down buttons respectively.</p>

<p>Fixed running a PipeDream command file when PipeDream is not running.
This had been broken since 4.52.00.</p>

<p>When running on a version of RISC OS where clicking in the Filer causes
the Filer to acquire the input focus, double-clicking a PipeDream Command
file in the Filer will execute that command file in the context of the
document that had the input focus before it was acquired by the Filer.</p>

<p>Record command file will once again create command files in the same
directory as the current document. If the current document has not been
saved, it will create the command file in
&lt;Choices$Write&gt;.PipeDream.CmdFiles.</p>

<p>Do command file will now list any command files found in the same
directory as the current document (and in any subdirectory CmdFiles thereof)
in addition to those found on the path.</p>

<p>Dump dictionary and Merge dictionary processing enormously speeded up on
newer systems.</p>

<p>Colour handling has been improved to allow selection of arbitrary colours
for each PipeDream display element using the ColourPicker module. Previously
such selection was restricted to the Window Manager 16-colour palette. Where
a newly selected colour exactly matches that in the Window Manager 16-colour
palette, its palette index is displayed, otherwise the corresponding HTML
colour code #RRGGBB is displayed.</p>

<p>The PipeDream colour constructs have been extended to store new colours
and now take the extended form: %OP%C&lt;c&gt;,&lt;index&gt;{,0xBBGGRR00}
(the hexadecimal colour parameter is omitted for exactly matching
colours).</p>

<p>English date format relabelled as D.M.Y in the Options dialogue box
and referred to as British-style in documentation.
American date format similarly relabelled as M.D.Y</p>

<p>The Load file dialogue box is now only created as a RISC OS submenu if it
is invoked by traversing the RISC OS menu structure using the arrow at the
right of the Load menu option. If the Load file dialogue box is invoked by
clicking on the Load menu option, from a command sequence (^FL) or a
user-defined mapped keystroke, it is opened as a standalone dialogue box.
This allows the user to then find a directory viewer containing files to be
loaded without the dialogue box collapsing. A file may then be dragged into
the Load file dialogue box, filling the file name field, and options
relevant to loading that file selected. To cancel the dialogue box, press
ESCAPE or click the Cancel button. Note that no other PipeDream dialogue
boxes can be invoked whilst the Load dialogue box is being shown as a
standalone dialogue box.</p>

<p>Save/Discard/Cancel and Yes/No dialogue boxes have been cosmetically
improved by splitting the message that was output into a (possibly quite
long) statement followed by a shorter discrete question.</p>

<p>A Web button (and a PipeDream logo) has been added to the About this
program dialogue box. This uses the PipeDream$Web variable set by !Run.</p>

<p>Window Manager flags bit is set to save and restore FP state over SWI
Wimp_Poll and Wimp_PollIdle calls rather than doing it manually.</p>

<p>The PipeDream application and file icons have been smartened up to better
match the actual PipeDream 4 logo artwork.</p>

<p>180 DPI application and file icons supplied in RISC OS 5 style.</p>

<p>Toolbar icons appearance improved and 180 DPI toolbar icons supplied;
some toolbar icons are now derived from the public domain Tango Icon
Library.</p>

<p>Toolbar is slightly less tall, leaving some more room for data.</p>

<p>Mark document/Clear selection Toolbar button added, replacing the box to
the left of the column headings.</p>

<p>Using one of the highlight Toolbar buttons with a marked block now
redraws correctly. Additionally, the corresponding option is set in the
Remove highlights dialogue box in case you wish to remove the highlights
thus set.</p>

<p>Clicking Adjust on the Left justify Toolbar button will restore the
default justification on the marked block (or current cell).</p>

<p>Clicking Adjust on the Decimal places Toolbar button will restore the
default format on the marked block (or current cell).</p>

<p>Clicking Adjust on Toolbar buttons with no alternate function defined
will no longer execute the standard function used when Select is
clicked.</p>

<p>Formula Editing Window buttons more consistent with Toolbar buttons.</p>

<p>Copy/Cut/Paste buttons added to Formula Editing Window.</p>

<p>Clicking Adjust on the Tick button transfers the formula line contents to
the Formula Editing Window.</p>

<p>Multi-line formula editing (and chart text) window only uses fonts if a
Desktop font is in use.</p>

<p>Unintentional zero page access when loading blank file name fixed.</p>

<p>Top level Help menu entry added.</p>

<p>Interactive Help messages are now given for the Formula Editing Window
buttons.</p>

<p>Interactive Help messages are now more consistent with the RISC OS Style
Guide recommendations and use Help tokens where possible.</p>

<p>Writeable icons in Spell Create/Open/Pack user dictionary dialogue boxes
use RISC OS Style Guide compliant appearance and size.</p>

<p>Menus are no longer padded to a fixed field width with spaces.</p>

<p>
    Application resources moved from !PipeDream.Resource. to !PipeDream.AppData.
    Language-specific resources (Dictionaries, Dictionary Definition Files, Document Templates, PipeDream Printer Drivers)
    are located in a sub-directory of AppData.
    The only one currently provided fully populated is UK.
    The Deutsch DictDefn file is provided in the Germany directory.
    Language-neutral resources (Markers, Pictures) may be found in the Neutral sub-directory of AppData.
    PipeDream$Path is set by !Boot and !Run and is used to locate these resources.
</p>

<p>
    RISC&nbsp;OS-type resources are now located in !PipeDream.Resources.
    (They had previously been separated out of the Resource directory into a RISC_OS sub-directory).
    Language-specific RISC&nbsp;OS-type resources (Help, Messages, Sprites, Window Templates) are located in a sub-directory of Resources.
    The only one currently provided is UK.
    Language-neutral RISC&nbsp;OS-type resources (Loader, ImageSlot) may be found in the Neutral sub-directory of AppData.
    A new variable, PipeDreamRes$Path, is set by !Run and is used to locate these resources.
    Verified that themed variants of these resources, e.g. iMX6, can be loaded on RISC OS 5 if provided by the user.
</p>

<p>
    Resources.UK.Help.HTML is a directory containing helpful info and supersedes the old HTMLHelp file.
    It now contains Command Reference, Spreadsheet Functions and Toolbar information.
</p>

<p>Internal error handler improved to show Continue and Quit button pair with more logical outcomes.</p>

<p>Stack overflow handler fixed - no longer gives 'Uncaught trap'.</p>

<p>Release notes are now located at top level in !PipeDream.</p>

<p>ROOL DDE 27 build environment used.</p>


<H4>4.55.04 (01 Aug 2016)</H4>

<p>CODE() spreadsheet function extended to accept empty string as input (in
which case it returns zero).</p>

<p>Custom function debugging assisted by outputting errors encountered as
<PRE>ERROR_CUSTOM: [<em>cf_doc_name</em>] Row <em>N</em> Error <em>String</em> </PRE>
to Reporter module if it is loaded and enabled.</p>


<H4>4.55.03 (27 Jul 2016)</H4>

<p>Choosing a spreadsheet function from the function selector menu enters
the formula editing line when clicked on an empty cell regardless of the New
cell format option.</p>

<p>The Copyright file in the PipeDream package explicitly includes a copy of
the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.</p>


<H4>4.55.02 (12 Jul 2016)</H4>

<p>Formula editing window (obtained by pressing Ctrl-Return in the formula
line) uses DejaVuSans.Mono if it is available AND a Unicode Font Manager is
in use.</p>

<p>Showing cell / range / name values from function menu puts a colon suffix
after the cell reference / range / name.</p>

<p>Function menu now allows cell / range values to be evaluated in custom
function sheets again. This had been deliberately disabled in 4.52/06 but
there can be a real use for this when debugging custom function sheets!</p>

<p>Correctly accumulates spaces between symbols when compiling formula for
number cell. This had been broken since 4.52/08 when leading equals sign was
first allowed. Trailing spaces before an internal newline are omitted.</p>


<H4>4.55.01 (03 Jul 2016)</H4>

<p>Check overwrite file dialogue box will take priority over any possibly
persisting Save dialogue box.</p>


<H4>4.55 (21 May 2016)</H4>

<p>PipeDream chart files are now PRM-conformant Draw files and can be loaded
by Draw, Vector and Fireworkz when the file type is set to Draw. They can
still be loaded by previous versions of PipeDream.</p>

<p>Image file loader updated to handle Vector files.</p>

<p>Image file loader updated to handle sprites with mode selectors.</p>

<p>Image file loader updated to better handle JPEGs.</p>

<p>Uses ChangeFSI, if available, to convert a much wider range of image file
formats. On machines where the OS is not shadowed in RAM, you can improve
ChangeFSI's performance by first typing '*RMFaster BASIC'.</p>

<p>Scrap files for image conversion are created in the
&lt;Wimp$ScrapDir&gt;.PipeDream directory.</p>

<p>Fixed potential error leak in LINEST().</p>

<p>Fixed URLs in notes for new CMS.</p>

<p>Coloured tick and cross for accept / cancel buttons of formula line.</p>

<p>Document file sprites have turned-up bottom right corner.</p>

<p>Fixed long-standing spell check dictionary creation / packing
exception.</p>

<p>Dropped support for ancient 'Integrale' format spell check dictionaries
which required ODctDefn.</p>

<p>Updated Master dictionary with many new words (from SCOWL). The Master
dictionary that now ships with PipeDream contains words with -<EM>ise</EM>
style endings which are common in written British English. A Master
dictionary containing words with -<EM>ize</EM> style endings (<A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling">Oxford English
Dictionary spelling</A>) may be obtained from the web site and substituted
for that shipped with PipeDream. The old PipeDream dictionary containing
both -<EM>ise</EM> and -<EM>ize</EM> style endings may also be obtained from
the web site.</p>


<H4>4.54 (22 Nov 2015)</H4>

<p>Dialogue box fields and buttons in Templates updated to conform to Style
Guide Issue 3. These still work OK if a slightly larger Desktop font for is
selected for readability (tested with 14pt Homerton.Medium set by Paul
Vigay's !MiscSetup) and also with RISC OS 4.39 styled icons.</P>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Quit query dialogue box buttons have been
reordered to be Style Guide Issue 3 compliant (Discard / Cancel / Save).
Take care to click in the right place! The Save-on-close dialogue box now
uses the same button set as the Quit query dialogue box.</p>

<p>References to 'Slot' replaced by 'Cell' to better relate to other
spreadsheet terminology.</p>

<p>Fix for lines longer than the maximum window width causing unrelated
nearby memory to be accessed.</p>

<p>If a PipeDream command file is open for editing in PipeDream,
double-clicking on it or dragging it to the PipeDream icon will bring the
corresponding document window to the front, as happens with other documents,
rather than executing it.</p>

<p>'Can't load this type of file' error will be given when DataPower, Lotus
.WK1/.WK3 or Microsoft Excel files are dragged to PipeDream.</p>

<p>COUNTA() spreadsheet function has been backported from Fireworkz.</p>

<p>SORT() spreadsheet function uses zero-based column index as per
documentation (and Fireworkz).</p>

<p>AVG() / MAX() / MIN() / SUM() spreadsheet functions now actually use the
optimised for integer arguments code that has been in there and laying
dormant for twenty-odd years!</p>

<p>Formula editing window (obtained by pressing Ctrl-Return in the formula
line) uses DejaVuSans.Mono if it is available.</p>

<p>Fix for loading chart file before the document on which it is
dependent.</p>

<p>The 3-D chart terms roll and pitch have been replaced by the terms turn
and droop that better describe their actions (chart turns about y-axis,
floor of chart droops forwards from the x-axis).</p>

<p>Selected objects in chart editing window are indicated using improved
exclusive OR colour selection code.</p>

<p>Chart legend object may be resized in chart editing window by dragging on
its top left corner (or bottom right corner as before).</p>

<p>Cancel buttons in chart style dialogue boxes.</p>

<P>Chart dialogue boxes no longer have a close icon (and thereby possibly
unwanted iconise icon) on the title bar.</P>

<p>Dashed lines in charts work correctly.</p>

<p>Polygonal Draw objects in charts now closed correctly.</p>

<p>Non-rectangular quadrilateral Draw paths in charts use rounded joints.
This avoids mitred joints of non-Thin lines poking well beyond 3-D bars.</p>

<p>Greatly improved click selection of objects in charts; more refined tests
are applied if the simple object bounding box is hit.</p>

<p>Acorn SID format files will be detected and loaded as CSV.</p>

<p>Some JPEG/JFIF files (e.g. with thumbnail pictures) were not being
automatically detected as such.</p>

<p>ROOL DDE 26 build environment used.</p>


<H4>Previous versions</H4> <p>The full release history may be found <A
HREF="http://croftnuisk.co.uk/coltsoft/pipedream/release_history">online</A>;
just the last few revisions of PipeDream are documented here.</p>


<H2 ID="KnownProblems">Known Problems In This Release</H2>

<P>It is still possible (and has been since PipeDream 3) to create circular
dependencies in @slot_ref@ chains which fail to complete calculation.</P>

<P>Pressing ESCAPE whilst dragging a file somewhere to be saved may
sometimes cause a Data Abort.</P>

<P>There is a problem whereby a document does not reload a newly created
chart properly. If an chart is created and a copy of the chart is saved out
as a Draw file (with a different name) then the chart will not reload after
being closed down. It will reload successfully if PipeDream is
restarted.</P>

<P>Exporting charts directly to other applications (e.g. EasyWriter) as Draw
files via the Message_RAMFetch / Message_RAMTransfer mechanism only works if
the application being exported to asks for the whole file in one go as the
protocol is stopped by PipeDream after the first Message_RAMFetch is
responded to.</P>


<H2>Warnings</H2>

<P>When using Virtualise or a similar virtual memory manager on RISC PCs,
install Virtualise *before* PipeDream is loaded. This is required because
PipeDream optimises its memory handling differently when VM is active on its
area - the only way it knows this is by comparing the maximum size of the
area with what it should be were VM not active i.e. Virtualise must have
been allowed to alter the maximum size of an area before PipeDream is
loaded.</P>


<H2>32-bit !System</H2>

<P>Please note that the latest distribution of !System for use with
pre-RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;5 computers may be found on the RISC&nbsp;OS Open web
site at:<BR/> &nbsp;<BR/> <A
HREF="https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/other-zipfiles">https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/other-zipfiles</A><BR/>
&nbsp;<BR/> under the heading: <STRONG>System resources</STRONG></P>

<P>NB Do NOT use the standard merge dialogue in
!Boot &gt; Configuration &gt; System Merge</P>

<P>because part of the update must refresh files in a directory that the
merge dialogue cannot reach.</P>

<P>Instead, a simple obey file is included called !SysMerge. Just double
click on !SysMerge.</P>
