    <h1>Mouse operations</h1>
    <p>
        This gives a summary of the mouse operations available in PipeDream.
        It is intended as a reminder rather than an exhaustive reference.
        For more information refer to the section called Caret Movements in the <em>Reference Guide</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Many of these mouse operations are described interactively in the RISC OS !Help application when used in conjunction with PipeDream.</p>

    <h2>Opening a Pipedream window</h2>
    <p>To open a new PipeDream window, click Select on the PipeDream icon on the icon bar.</p>

    <h2>Bringing up menus and choosing commands</h2>
    <p>With the pointer in a PipeDream window, click Menu to bring up the top level menu.</p>
    <p>To bring up a sub-menu, drag the pointer over the arrow to the right of the menu name.</p>
    <p>
        To choose a command, click Select on the command name.
        This carries out the command and removes the menu from the screen.
        If you click Adjust, the menu remains on the screen.
    </p>

    <h2>Loading documents</h2>
    <p>To load a PipeDream document, either double-click on its icon, or drag its icon onto the Pipedream icon on the icon bar.</p>
    <p>To insert a file at the caret position, drag the file's icon into the window.</p>

    <h2>Positioning the caret</h2>
    <p>
        Always use the Select button to position the caret within cells.
        Normally the caret will be positioned in the cell you are pointing at.
        However, if there is a text cell to the left of the cell you are pointing at,
        PipeDream will position the caret in the cell to the left.
        This prevents you accidentally typing in columns to the right of where you expected.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you really want to position the caret to the right of a text cell, hold down Ctrl when you click Select.
        Alternatively a single click in the column border will move the caret into that column.
    </p>

    <h2>Marking blocks</h2>
    <p>To mark a block, hold down the Select button and drag from the top-left of the block to the bottom right.</p>
    <p>To mark complete columns, drag Select across the column borders.</p>
    <p>To mark complete rows, drag Select down the row borders.</p>
    <p>To mark one complete row, double-click Select in the row border.</p>
    <p>To mark one complete column, double-click Select in the column border.</p>
    <p>To clear any marked block, click in the Mark Block box at the intersection of the row and column borders.</p>
    <p>To mark the whole document, click Select in the Mark Block box at the intersection of the row and column borders.  </p>
    <p>
        To adjust a marked block after marking it, move the pointer to the point at which you now want the block to end and click Adjust.
        The marked block will now end where you click.
        The starting point will remain the same.
    </p>

    <h2>Scrolling the window</h2>
    <h3>Up and down</h3>
    <p>
        Position the pointer on the scroll arrow and click Select to scroll one line in the direction of the arrow.
        Hold down Select to continue scrolling.
        Click Adjust to scroll in the other direction.
        The caret always remains within the PipeDream window, staying as near as possible to its original position.
    </p>
    <p>
        Position the pointer on the darker part of the scroll bar
        (above the slider to scroll up, below the slider to scroll down) and click Select.
        The next windowful of the document will appear.
        Click Adjust to scroll back the other way.
        The caret always remains within the PipeDream window, moving, if necessary, to the point nearest to its position before scrolling.
    </p>
    <p>To move a long distance up or down drag the slider in the vertical scroll bar.</p>

    <h3>Left and right</h3>
    <p>Click on the left and right arrows in the horizontal scroll bars to move one column left or right.</p>
    <p>Click in the dark grey area of the scroll bar to move the window one windowful left or right.</p>
    <p>To move a long distance left or right drag the slider in the horizontal scroll bar.</p>

    <h2>Entering cell references into the editing line</h3>
    <p>
        To enter a cell reference into the editing line whilst you are editing an expression, click Select in the cell.
        The cell can be in the current window or in another, in which case you will insert an external reference.</p>
    </p>
