 PipeDream and User Choices
 --------------------------

 PipeDream now uses the Choices$Path to access the user's saved Choices
(and other common data).  Choices:PipeDream. has been added to the
PipeDream$DataPath variable, replacing <PipeDream$Dir>.User (or
<PipeDream$ResourceDir>.User if you used to use !PDGlobal to store global
resources for PipeDream).

 Choices, user dictionaries, new templates etc. are now written to the
appropriate location in <Choices$Write>.PipeDream. Subdirectories of
<Choices$Write>.PipeDream will be created as needed by PipeDream.

 If this is a fresh installation of PipeDream, PipeDream will run the
TaskObey script file DoCopy in this Choices directory which will copy the
contents of this directory into <Choices$Write>.PipeDream.

 As before, please note that if you already have modified user dictionaries
etc. in a previous non-choices installation of PipeDream (i.e. one prior to
4.50/37), you may wish to copy the contents of your existing
<PipeDream$Dir>.User tree into the new location <Choices$Write>.PipeDream.
If so, run your old !PipeDream (to set the correct <PipeDream$Dir>) and type
the following in a (Ctrl-F12) Task window:

 CDir <Choices$Write>.PipeDream
 Copy <PipeDream$Dir>.User.* <Choices$Write>.PipeDream.* ~CF~NRV
