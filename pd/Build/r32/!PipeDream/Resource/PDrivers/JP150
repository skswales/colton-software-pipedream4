	PipeDream printer driver

	This driver is for the Acorn/Olivetti JP150 printer 

	It is based on the driver for the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet
	and other HP PCL III compatibles.

	Created 31-Aug-89. Last modified 31-Oct-91.

	When loading a printer driver, PipeDream reads each 
	successive line looking for valid options.  Each valid 
	option contains a field in column A.  If column A is blank 
	PipeDream ignores the whole line.  So these opening 
	paragraphs will be ignored.

	The following three options all take one parameter which is 
	specified in column B.  The Printer on string specifies the 
	codes sent to the printer at the start of each print 
	session and, in the case of single page printing, at the 
	start of each page.  The Printer off string specifies the 
	codes sent to the printer at the end of each print session 
	and, in the case of single page printing, at the end of 
	each page.  The End of page string specifies the codes sent 
	at the end of each page.  Some printers can handle 
	formfeeds which are faster and quieter than the alternative 
	of sending linefeeds to end the page.
