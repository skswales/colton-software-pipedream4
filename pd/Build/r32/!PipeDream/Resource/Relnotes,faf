<H2>Release History</H2>

<p>The full release history may be found
<A HREF="http://croftnuisk.co.uk/coltsoft/pipedream/release_history">online</A>;
just the last few revisions of PipeDream are documented here.</p>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4>4.55 (21 May 2016)</H4>

<p>PipeDream chart files are now PRM-conformant Draw files and can be loaded by
Draw, Vector and Fireworkz when the file type is set to Draw. They can still be
loaded by previous versions of PipeDream.</p>

<p>Image file loader updated to handle Vector files.</p>

<p>Image file loader updated to handle sprites with mode selectors.</p>

<p>Image file loader updated to better handle JPEGs.</p>

<p>Uses ChangeFSI, if available, to convert a much wider range of image file formats.</p>

<p>On machines where the OS is not shadowed in RAM, you can improve ChangeFSI's performance by first typing '*RMFaster BASIC'.</p>

<p>Scrap files for image conversion are created in the &lt;Wimp$ScrapDir&gt;.PipeDream directory.</p>

<p>Fixed potential error leak in LINEST().</p>

<p>Fixed URLs in notes for new CMS.</p>

<p>Coloured tick and cross for accept / cancel buttons of formula line.</p>

<p>Document file sprites have turned-up bottom right corner.</p>

<p>Fixed long-standing spell check dictionary creation / packing exception.</p>

<p>Dropped support for ancient 'Integrale' format spell check dictionaries which required ODctDefn.</p>

<p>Updated Master dictionary with many new words (from SCOWL).
The Master dictionary that now ships with PipeDream contains words
with <I>-ise</I> style endings which are common in written British English.
A Master dictionary containing words with <I>-ize</I> style endings (<A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling">Oxford English Dictionary spelling</A>)
may be obtained from the web site and substituted for that shipped with PipeDream.
The old PipeDream dictionary containing both <I>-ise</I> and <I>-ize</I> style endings may also be obtained from the web site.</p>


<H4>4.54 (22 Nov 2015)</H4>

<p>Dialogue box fields and buttons in Templates updated to conform to Style Guide Issue 3.
These still work OK if a slightly larger Desktop font for is selected for readability (tested with 14pt Homerton.Medium set by Paul Vigay's !MiscSetup) and also with RISC OS 4.39 styled icons.</P>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Quit query dialogue box buttons have been reordered to be Style Guide Issue 3 compliant (Discard / Cancel / Save).
Take care to click in the right place! The Save-on-close dialogue box now uses the same button set as the Quit query dialogue box.</p>

<p>References to 'Slot' replaced by 'Cell' to better relate to other spreadsheet terminology.</p>

<p>Fix for lines longer than the maximum window width causing unrelated nearby memory to be accessed.</p>

<p>If a PipeDream macro file is open for editing in PipeDream, double-clicking on it or dragging it to the PipeDream icon will bring the corresponding document window to the front, as happens with other documents, rather than executing it.</p>

<p>'Can't load this type of file' error will be given when DataPower, Lotus .WK1/.WK3 or Microsoft Excel files are dragged to PipeDream.</p>

<p>COUNTA() spreadsheet function has been backported from Fireworkz.</p>

<p>SORT() spreadsheet function uses zero-based column index as per documentation (and Fireworkz).</p>

<p>AVG() / MAX() / MIN() / SUM() functions now actually use the optimised for integer arguments code that has been in there and laying dormant for twenty-odd years!</p>

<p>Formula editing window (obtained by pressing Ctrl-Return in the formula line) uses DejaVuSans.Mono if it is available.</p>

<p>Fix for loading chart file before the document on which it is dependent.</p>

<p>The 3-D chart terms roll and pitch have been replaced by the terms turn and droop that better describe their actions (chart turns about y-axis, floor of chart droops forwards from the x-axis).</p>

<p>Selected objects in chart editing window are indicated using improved exclusive OR colour selection code.</p>

<p>Chart legend object may be resized in chart editing window by dragging on its top left corner (or bottom right corner as before).</p>

<p>Cancel buttons in chart style dialogue boxes.</p>

<P>Chart dialogue boxes no longer have a close icon (and thereby possibly unwanted iconise icon) on the title bar.</P>

<p>Dashed lines in charts work correctly.</p>

<p>Polygonal Draw objects in charts now closed correctly.</p>

<p>Non-rectangular quadrilateral Draw paths in charts use rounded joints. This avoids mitred joints of non-Thin lines poking well beyond 3-D bars.</p>

<p>Greatly improved click selection of objects in charts; more refined tests are applied if the simple object bounding box is hit.</p>

<p>Acorn SID format files will be detected and loaded as CSV.</p>

<p>Some JPEG/JFIF files (e.g. with thumbnail pictures) were not being automatically detected as such.</p>

<p>ROOL DDE 26 build environment used.</p>

<P>NB To help design-time icon alignment, most icons in PipeDream's template
files have the border flag applied, which is then stripped off at run-time.</P>


<A ID="KnownProblems">
<H2>Known Problems In This Release</H2>

<P>It is still possible (and has been since PipeDream 3) to create circular dependencies
in @slot_ref@ chains which fail to complete calculation.</P>

<P>Stack overflows which should raise(SIGSTAK) instead give 'Uncaught trap'.</P>

<P>Pressing ESCAPE whilst dragging a file somewhere to be saved may sometimes
cause a Data Abort.</P>

<P>There is a problem whereby a document does not reload a newly created chart
properly. If an chart is created and a copy of the chart is saved out as a
drawfile (with a different name) then the chart will not reload after being
closed down. It will reload successfully if PipeDream is restarted.</P>

<P>Exporting charts directly to other applications (e.g. EasyWriter) as Draw
files via the Message_RAMFetch / Message_RAMTransfer mechanism only works if
the application being exported to asks for the whole file in one go as the
protocol is stopped by PipeDream after the first Message_RAMFetch is
responded to.</P>


<H2>Warnings</H2>

<P>When using Virtualise or a similar virtual memory manager on RISC PCs,
install Virtualise *before* you load in PipeDream. This is because
PipeDream optimises its memory handling differently when VM is active on its
area - the only way it knows this is by comparing the maximum size of the
area with what it should be were VM not active i.e. Virtualise must have
been allowed to alter the maximum size of an area before PipeDream loads in.</P>


<H2>32-bit !System</H2>

<P>Please note that the latest distribution of !System for use with pre-RISC
OS 5 machines may be found on the RISC&nbsp;OS Open website at:</P>

<p>under the heading:</P>

<P><B>System resources</B></P>

<P>NB Do NOT use the merge dialogue in</P>

<P> !Boot &gt; Configuration &gt; System Merge</P>

<P>because part of the update must refresh files in a directory that the merge
dialogue cannot reach. Instead, a simple obey file is included called
!SysMerge. Just double click on !SysMerge.</P>
