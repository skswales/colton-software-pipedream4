<H2>Release history</H2>

<H4>4.52/05 (16 Jul 2014)</H4>

<P>Problem with ROUND() spreadsheet function fixed.</P>

<P>Improved text and layout of Save/Discard/Cancel dialogue box on exit with modified document(s).</P>

<P>PD4Keys command file is no longer shipped - it was only there to revert from PD3Keys.</P>


<H4>4.52/04 (04 Jul 2014)</H4>

<P>Issue with PipeDream's font cache mechanism could sometimes lead to
highlighted text not being rendered in the correct font variant.</P>

<P>Text @-fields containing cell references to other cells containing text
@-fields containing cell references&ellipsis; now render sensibly, allowing
text to be concatenated. There is a fixed depth limit of nine (rather than
the old effective limit of one).</P>

<P>Text @-fields containing cell references to other cells containing text
@-fields containing cell references (and these did't get expanded, by the
way: see above) could yield incorrect cell references when the target cell
was deleted. This has been there since the very early days of PipeDream as
far as I can see! Any text @-field containing a bad cell is displayed with a
leading percent character, as it would shown for bad cell references in
formulae.</P>

<P>Text @-fields containing cell references could yield incorrect cell
references when updated (broken in 4.50/43). Several slightly inconsistent
instances of cell reference reading/writing code replaced with fast
consistent routines.</P>

<P>Propagated errors now contain a reference to the cell that generated the
initial error to help fault-finding.</P>

<P>Unary plus and minus operators and ABS() spreadsheet function no longer
unnecessarily convert integer arguments to floating point.</P>

<P>If the <I>length</I> parameter is omitted for LEFT() and RIGHT()
spreadsheet functions, <I>length</I> of 1 is assumed. A <I>length</I> of 0
is now allowed (consistency with MID()).</P>

<P>AVG() and SUM() spreadsheet functions fixed: operating on extremely large
ranges of individually small integers could eventually give an undetected
integer overflow.</P>

<P>LOGEST() spreadsheet function fixed: could have crashed PipeDream when
given fewer than three parameters.</P>

<P>M_INVERSE() spreadsheet function now yields correct error for non-square
input matrix.</P>

<P>Calculation of determinants of large matrices would have caused heap
corruption.</P>

<P>Very large numbers formatted as X# (column name) could have crashed
PipeDream.</P>

<P>Group box captions use better icon style for patterned background.</P>

<P>Changed writable field height to 60 OS units - the RISC&nbsp;OS Style
Guide's suggested 68 OS units is way too tall.</P>


<H4>4.52/03 (18 Feb 2014)</H4>

<P>tboxlibs' flex module compiled into PipeDream (with patches). Added
shrink_forbid option (needed for running out of memory when printing problem
as for 4.50/09). Added flex allocation granularity mechanism to tboxlibs'
flex module to avoid unnecessary overheads and slot/area thrashing.</P>

<P>Spurious carriage return characters removed from Messages file.</P>

<P>No longer supports squashed Messages file (for source clarity).</P>


<H4>4.52/02 (12 Feb 2014)</H4>

<P>PipeDream released under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL).</P>

<P>The installed Event and Escape handlers are now truly 26/32-bit agnostic:
they do not modify flags, so do not attempt to restore them.</P>


<H4>4.52/01 (09 Feb 2014)</H4>

<P>Initialisation order with flex and dynamic areas fixed. Caused exception
on shutdown if fonts had been used in any documents when a dynamic area had
been created (bug was introduced in 4.51).</P>


<H4>4.52 (06 Feb 2014)</H4>

<P>PipeDream package created for use with !PackMan or RiscPkg. If you do not
wish to use a package manager, you may extract !PipeDream as before from the
ZIP archive - it is in Apps.Document.</P>

<P>Choices directory moved back from top level into !PipeDream as uChoices to
assist packaging. PipeDream will now test for the existence of choices in
&lt;Choices$Write&gt;.PipeDream on startup and, if needed, copy the default
choices directories and files from uChoices over to Choices:PipeDream.</P>

<P>As before, please note that if you already have modified user dictionaries
etc. in a previous non-choices installation of PipeDream (i.e. one prior to
4.50/37), you may wish to copy the contents of your existing
&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.User tree into the new location &lt;Choices$Write&gt;.PipeDream.</P>
If so, run your old !PipeDream (to set the correct &lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;) and type
the following in a (Ctrl-F12) Task window:</P>

<PRE>
CDir &lt;Choices$Write&gt;.PipeDream
Copy &lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.User.* &lt;Choices$Write&gt;.PipeDream.* ~CF~NRV
</PRE>

<P>Release notes are now in HTML format and linked into !Help.</P>

<P>Changed release notes to include PipeDream Google Group info (was Fireworkz).</P>

<P>Changed Loader to display PipeDream Google Group info (was Fireworkz).</P>


<H4>4.51 (06 Jan 2014)</H4>

<P>Fonts used in Draw files that are used as pictures / markers in charts now
match up with existing fonts in the charts much better. It is now also
possible to include Draw files that use text in a font that is otherwise
unused in the chart: since 4.50/41 (when an optimised font table was added)
this would have mapped text in the included font to display using System
font.</P>

<P>PipeDream now works out when null events are required and also registers
the list of messages in which it is interested with the Window Manager
(helps overall RISC&nbsp;OS Desktop efficiency).</P>

<P>Use tboxlibs' flex module for deferred compaction.</P>

<P>Fixed SIGOSERROR handling and reporting of other exceptions.</P>

<P>Patched out more unused bits of RISC_OSLib.</P>

<P>Replaced multiple calls to OS_WriteC with OS_WriteN to speed graphics past
the VDU funnel and multiple SWI overheads.</P>

<P>Calls to OS_Plot via SWI CallASWI replaced with direct SWI OS_Plot.</P>

<P>Many more return paths from Window Manager (and other) SWIs now check for
unlikely, but still possible, errors which could otherwise have been hidden
and not reported. Use of inline function wrapper means this is just a CMP
#0; BLNE report per call.</P>

<P>PipeDream can now be built on 32-bit systems, including RPCEmu (RO 5.20).</P>

<P>PipeDream repository converted to Subversion (from CVS).</P>

<P>Fixed !Help for Save dialogue box.</P>

<P>Messages file now supplied uncompressed and unpreprocessed.</P>

<P>No longer supports squashed Sprites or Sprites22.</P>

<P>Reporter output is now disabled by default. It may be enabled by *Set
PipeDream$ReportEnable 1 before running PipeDream.</P>


<H4>4.50/50 (08 Aug 2013)</H4>

<P>Adjust-clicking the Yes (or No) button in Yes/No choice dialogue boxes acts
as if the No (or Yes) button had been clicked. This restores the sense
prior to the 4.50/49 fix. This also applies to the Save/Discard choice box.</P>

<P>Sequences of consequent dialogue boxes (when closing PipeDream with a
number of modified documents) now remember the Yes/No dialogue box position
for the subsequent Yes/No dialogue box to be opened at, preventing the
progressive crawl of dialogue boxes towards the bottom right of the screen
if any modified document was saved.</P>


<H4>4.50/49 (02 Aug 2013)</H4>

<P>Fixed page numbering on printing. This had broken in 4.50/37 when code to
handle printing multi-file documents was removed (support for multi-file
documents themselves having been dropped many many moons ago).</P>

<P>Fixed RISC&nbsp;OS printing with line spacing &gt; 1 and grid turned on.</P>

<P>Quit messsage with edited documents made more helpful.</P>

<P>Removed spurious '&gt;' from Edit Name menu entries.</P>

<P>Text @-field sequences are all now fully expanded when displaying the
contents of a string cell in the same way as a text cell would be. Prior to
this version, the display of string cells containing text @-field sequences
was inconsistent (PipeDream did try to use font and colour changes, but not
date, title etc. expansion) and was in fact broken.</P>

<P>Adjust-clicking the OK button in dialogue boxes to allow sub-menu
persistence works again (it was broken for most dialogue boxes in 4.50/36
where Cancel buttons were added but there were already a couple where it
would have gone wrong anyway; all due to non-zero ESG usage on action
buttons being a hangover from RISC&nbsp;OS 2 menu-style buttons).</P>

<P>More robust error handling of malformed command args from command files or
key expansion: in some cases it could have tried to pop up a dialogue box.</P>


<H4>4.50/48 (28 Jun 2013)</H4>

<P>Numbers template now uses Homerton.Medium font. There is also a copy of the
previous Numbers template, shipped as Numb_Plain, that still uses the system
font.</P>

<P>Save Choices command moved into the PipeDream icon bar Choices sub-menu.</P>

<P>The user name & organisation name are no longer displayed in the 'About
this program' dialogue box as PipeDream is now free-to-use and no longer has
a registration process. If you have upgraded PipeDream from a paid version
and have valid registration information in &lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.Info, it will
still be displayed on the splash screen and stored in your saved files.</P>

<P>Help command added to the PipeDream icon bar menu for ease of access.</P>

<P>PipeDream Help now also mentions the on-line Tutorial.</P>

<P>Certain commands are no longer greyed out on menus when in expression
editing as they do specifically cater for this case:
<UL>
<LI>   Next Match,
<LI>   Previous Match,
<LI>   Replace *,
<LI>   Search.
</UL>

<P>* Command does not appear on visible menus.</P>

<P>Superfluous (since 1989!) field removed from menu structures.</P>

<P>The field in the Print dialogue box that contains the Printer name now has
a transparent background so as to conform with textured window backgrounds.</P>

<P>Background colour of the text section in the splash screen adjusted to be
closer to that of the image background on high-colour displays.</P>

<P>PD3Keys command file is no longer shipped - you've all had plenty of time
to adapt!</P>


<H4>4.50/47 (24 Jun 2013)</H4>

<P>Save processing now always ignores RISC_OSLib's initially poorly defined
xfersend_file_is_safe() state unless the save has been performed using
xfersend() - i.e. by dragging the file icon or clicking OK in the Save
dialogue box. This fixes the long-standing \Fgs failure to reset the file
modified flag problem.</P>

<P>Standalone Save dialogue box re-enabled now \Fgs problem fixed.</P>

<P>Pressing ESCAPE during a non-PipeDream file save could possibly not abort
the save process if recalculation was not complete.</P>

<P>File-&gt;About now shows correct file modification date again.</P>


<H4>4.50/46 (20 Jun 2013)</H4>

<P>Standalone Save dialogue box temporarily disabled while we try to get to
the bottom of a particularly opaque \Fgs problem.</P>

<P>Pop-up version (one that does not read its arguments from a command file or
function key) of the Save dialogue box created for use when \Fgs|M is issued
in a command file or function key expansion and the current document does
not yet have a full pathname.</P>

<P>Macro recording could sometimes fail when writing out a post-command
newline.</P>

<P>Full pathname of macro file given when write fails.</P>

<P>More commands greyed out on menus when in expression editing.</P>

<P>No longer explicitly set Spell Dump Dictionary output buffer size (it was
smaller than the current default).</P>

<P>Dump Dictionary is now much faster with empty template for quicker
dictionary maintenance (it updates the on-screen dialogue box less often and
processes more words per null event).</P>


<H4>4.50/45 (05 Jun 2013)</H4>

<P>HTML Help now refers to the online PipeDream Reference Guide.</P>

<P>When dragging, e.g. column width adjusting, inappropriate BubbleHelp for
PipeDream document windows is suppressed.</P>

<P>Files loaded from sources that are not deemed as 'safe', e.g. as a selection
dragged to the PipeDream icon from another editor, are once again marked as
modified and untitled, rather than as unmodified and with the name of the
Scrap file used for the transfer (was broken in 4.50/41).</P>

<P>Inserting a file which contains external references now causes the document
into which it is inserted to attempt to load any newly supporting documents.</P>

<P>Inserting files, either by dragging or Ctrl-FL, no longer cause the
document window to be re-opened at a 'new document' position.</P>

<P>PipeDream's dialogue box processing no longer greedily steals the caret
back to the current field in open dialogue boxes, so allowing the user to
perform other useful tasks (e.g. file rename, directory creation) whilst in a
standalone dialogue box such as Save file.</P>

<P>The Save file dialogue box now attempts to restore the caret on closing
when it is opened as a standalone dialogue box.</P>

<P>Several potential buffer overflow bugs (esp. with long filenames) fixed.</P>

<P>32-bit Lotus 1-2-3 converter utilities u_ltp (Lotus to PipeDream) and u_ptl
(PipeDream to Lotus) are now supplied in PipeDream's Resource.RISC_OS
directory (this being a bit more out of the way of other files loaded on the
PipeDream path). Please note that there is no cute front end tool - you
will need to invoke them in a (Ctrl-F12) Task window:</P>

<PRE>
PipeDream:RISC_OS.u_ltp &lt;infile-lotus&gt; &lt;outfile-pipedream&gt;
PipeDream:RISC_OS.u_ptl &lt;infile-pipedream&gt; &lt;outfile-lotus&gt;
</PRE>


<H4>4.50/44 (13 May 2013)</H4>

<P>Failed supporting document load reporting in 4.50/43 had the unwanted
side-effects of (a) stopping any subsequent supporting document loading for
that stack of dependent and supporting documents and (b) possibly aborting
any command file execution.</P>

<P>Some useful error messages were being suppressed.</P>

<P>All error messages displayed in Window Manager Message Box are now
additionaly logged to Reporter.</P>

<P>Supply the user Choices directory in the top-level alongside !PipeDream.
Please refer to the ReadMe in the Choices directory for further details.</P>


<H4>4.50/43 (09 May 2013)</H4>

<P>The spreadsheet evaluator and general document internal identifiers have
been unified (like in Fireworkz) to rid PipeDream of this artificial and
unnecessary distinction. This had hampered getting to the bottom of many
external reference and supporting document loading problems through the
years. It also simplifies the document handling to spreadsheet module
interface code somewhat (with incidental speed up).</P>

<P>Loading supporting documents and external references code rationalised.
Where some of the supporting documents were being loaded along
PipeDream$UserPath, a redundant and sometimes conflicting copy of a file
name variable was present before, also the 'looser match' flags was not
being set correctly in all cases.</P>

<P>These two modifications above also permit supporting documents with the
same leafname but in different directories to be loaded at the same time,
e.g. ADFS:...Tax.2012.Summary would load supporting files Rental and Bank
from ...2012 but loading ADFS:...Tax.2013.Summary at the same time would
load the supporting files with the same names from ...2013 as you would want
rather than refusing.</P>

<P>Failed supporting document load is now reported (to screen and log) again.</P>

<P>When a document window that contains the input focus in a cell is reduced
in extent, the caret is correctly repositioned within the adjusted current
cell position.</P>

<P>Double-clicking on a document icon in a directory viewer that is already
loaded in PipeDream (whether modified or not) will simply bring that
document to the front, acquiring the input focus. This also applies to a
document icon being dragged to the PipeDream icon on the icon bar.</P>

<P>Double-clicking on a chart file icon that is used in a PipeDream document
simply shows it in a chart editing window without giving an 'already loaded'
error.</P>

<P>The Save file dialogue box is now only created as a RISC&nbsp;OS submenu if it
is invoked by traversing the RISC&nbsp;OS menu structure using the arrow at the
right of the Save menu option. If the Save file dialogue box is invoked by
clicking on the Save menu option, from a command sequence (^FS), mapped
keystroke (F3) or from the toolbar button, it is opened as a standalone
dialogue box. This allows the user to then find a suitable directory viewer
to drag the file icon to without the dialogue box collapsing. To cancel the
dialogue box, press ESCAPE or click the Cancel button. Note that no other
PipeDream dialogue boxes can be invoked whilst the Save dialogue box is
being shown as a standalone dialogue box.</P>

<P>In addition to checking whether a file is being saved to a 'safe' place, or
is only having a partial range saved, saving a document to a file now also
only renames the document in memory if it is being saved in its original
format or in PipeDream format. This permits exporting documents to other
formats using the Save file function without perturbing any external
references.</P>

<P>Large file loading speeded up by optimising inner loops of load procedure
for PipeDream files, together with an early check whether each cell contains
text @-fields (most do not) allowing elimination of superfluous data copies.</P>

<P>Use larger buffer and improved buffered I/O code when reading and writing
files (overall factor of 2+ speed improvement in both seen for large text
files on a RISC PC).</P>

<P>Spreadsheet file loading speeded up by use of improved number reading code
that performs earlier rejection of character sequences that won't be
recognised as numbers (e.g dates, slot / range references). It now also
reads numbers as integers where that is possible. Both these cases used to
spend too much time in FP number decode.</P>

<P>File loading attempts to determine the line separator character(s) for use
when saving non-PipeDream format documents. PipeDream format documents
default to suggesting LF for save.</P>

<P>Shift-click on the PipeDream icon will open the Choices:PipeDream
directory, in which you can find sub-directories containing the user-created
Templates and CmdFiles (amongst others) that are used by PipeDream.</P>

<P>'Log labels' option in chart value axes dialogue boxes has been changed to
'Power (10^n) labels'. When used with log scaling, this gives the same
results as before, but now can be applied without selecting log scaling.</P>

<P>Filenames containing commas no longer cause the Documents and Charts
sub-menus to foul up.</P>

<P>Documents and Charts sub-menus are now potentially double the width before
entries are truncated and prefixed with ellipsis (for modern wider screens
and fonty menus with thinner chars).</P>

<P>Help changed from PipeDream file to HTML help.</P>

<P>32-bit Lotus 1-2-3 converter utilities u_ltp (Lotus to PipeDream) and u_ptl
(PipeDream to Lotus) are now supplied in PipeDream's Resource directory.</P>
Please note that there is no cute front end tool - you will need to invoke
them in a (Ctrl-F12) Task window:</P>

<PRE>
PipeDream:u_ltp &lt;infile-lotus&gt; &lt;outfile-pipedream&gt;
PipeDream:u_ptl &lt;infile-pipedream&gt; &lt;outfile-lotus&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Removed archaic floppy-disc outline logo from splash screen.</P>


<H4>4.50/42 (22 Mar 2013)</H4>

<P>Fixed bug where a reference to a document that failed to load could crash
on use (could affect both spreadsheet and charts).</P>


<H4>4.50/41 (19 Mar 2013)</H4>

<P>Dependent document loading / naming code overhauled.</P>

<P>Allow code to run again on processors that don't support UMULL (i.e. all
pre-ARM600 CPUs) by dynamic patching of code for those systems. This was
broken in 4.50/35 when PipeDream began using UMULL to speed 64-bit multiply
operations.</P>

<P>Shift-click on the PipeDream icon will open the Choices: Templates
directory.</P>

<P>Avoid chart creation exception when one series' data is all emptied.</P>

<P>Charts are created with a Draw font table that specifies just the fonts
actually used by the chart, not all the fonts present in the system.</P>

<P>Chart line gallery code works again (it was broken in 4.50/36 where Cancel
buttons added).</P>

<P>Lighter grid colour used by default.</P>

<P>Document title bar modified indicator is set/reset at correct point.</P>


<H4>4.50/40 (30 Oct 2012)</H4>

<P>Loading sheets with multiple levels of supporting documents now works as
intended. For example, where Sheet_A depends on Sheet_B which depends on
Sheet_C; and where Sheet_A also depends on Sheet_C. Sheet_B load could
sometimes have failed or a spurious error could have been given after a
successful load of all of the set of supporting documents.</P>


<H4>4.50/39 (26 Oct 2012)</H4>

<P>@C@ (colour change) behaviour is now consistent between printing and
screen - the colour change is automatically cancelled at the end of a cell
rather than at the end of the printout or end of the line.</P>

<P>PipeDream no longer incorrectly warns about saving to itself when Return is
pressed in Save dialogue box with mouse pointer over the PipeDream window.</P>

<P>Fixed potential for evaluator crash (esp. custom functions) with
zero-length strings that has existed since 4.50/08.</P>

<P>Evaluator long buffer size for named objects increased to match longer
filename possibility.</P>

<P>Sliding window date handling would have failed in 2099!</P>

<P>Removed arbitrary 16-bit limit on evaluator array sizes.</P>

<P>Allow matrix inverse to be calculated for n &gt; 3.</P>

<P>BIN(), FLIP(), FORMULA_TEXT(), MEDIAN(), RANK(), SORT(), SPEARMAN(),
TEXT() spreadsheet functions backported from Fireworkz (see functions added
since 4.50/00 below).</P>

<P>CTERM() spreadsheet function can now take negative fv and pv arguments to
calculate debt accrual (as in Fireworkz).</P>

<P>INT() spreadsheet function now performs rounding (at the 14th significant
place) such that formulas which are affected by the imprecise floating point
representation of fractional numbers e.g. INT((0.06-0.02)/2E-6) yield the
correct integer value.</P>

<P>Ships with Master dictionary again (oops).</P>


<H4>4.50/38 (11 Oct 2012)</H4>

<P>Fixed possible crash when chart window is closed (introduced in /36).</P>

<P>Longer 'Goto slot' field and amended validation string for possible
external reference.</P>

<P>More code tidying.</P>

<P>ROOL RISC_OSLib now imported into separate pd/external directory.</P>

<P>Attempts support for Wimp$IconTheme for Sprites (RISC_OSLib convergence)
although no new themed sprites are actually supplied.</P>


<H4>4.50/37 (19 Sep 2012)</H4>

<P>Add Choices:PipeDream. to the PipeDream$Path variable, replacing
&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.User. Please note that if you already have user
dictionaries etc., you may wish to copy the contents of your existing
&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.User into &lt;Choices$Write&gt;.PipeDream:</P>

<PRE>
CDir &lt;Choices$Write&gt;.PipeDream
Copy &lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.User.* &lt;Choices$Write&gt;.PipeDream.* ~CRV
</PRE>

<P>User directory in !PipeDream has now been renamed as Choices.PipeDream.</P>
There is a TaskObey script file DoCopy in the Choices directory which will
copy the contents of this directory to &lt;Choices$Write&gt;.PipeDream.</P>

<P>Newly created user dictionaries, templates etc. are now written to the
appropriate location in &lt;Choices$Write&gt;.PipeDream so that each user's
choices may be placed outwith the !PipeDream directory. Subdirectories of
&lt;Choices$Write&gt;.PipeDream will be created as needed by PipeDream.</P>

<P>Save choices option is greyed out if there isn't a current document context
to execute the command in.</P>

<P>Larger buffer for the PipeDream$Path variable to be expanded into for deep
paths and/or very long PipeDream$UserPath path prefix dirs.</P>

<P>Now only checks that path element is a directory during each file load iff
there's a plausible match, eliminating redundant SWI calls.</P>

<P>Eliminated several redundant file open & close operations during file load.</P>

<P>Simplify !Boot and !Run now we no longer cater for running from a pair of
floppy disks.</P>

<P>Moved all Sprites, Templates and Messages files used by RISC_OSLib and
other assorted run-time stuff from the !PipeDream.Resources directory into
the new !PipeDream.Resource.RISC_OS directory to avoid any potential name
clashes with user's custom function sheets etc.</P>

<P>When closing a document window, no longer bring another document to the
front and set the caret into it. This avoids unwanted unpinning of
documents from the Pinboard.</P>

<P>Sequences of consequent dialogue boxes (when closing PipeDream with a
number of modified documents) now remember the dialogue box position for the
subsequent dialogue box to be opened at, preventing the progressive crawl of
dialogue boxes towards the bottom right of the screen.</P>

<P>Dialogue boxes opened as a result of a keyboard shortcut now appear near
the caret (in fact a short distance right and down), as originally intended.</P>
This had in fact been broken since the early days of PipeDream 3!

<P>Larger dialogue box margins to better accommodate 3-D internal window
borders and more modern, less cramped, style.</P>

<P>Writable icons use RISC&nbsp;OS Style Guide compliant appearance and size.</P>

<P>No longer force use of PipeDream's own radio, check and up/down buttons.</P>

<P>Large chart gallery and colour options dialogue boxes that are expandable
using the toggle icon now also have vertical scroll bars for operational
clarity.</P>

<P>Fixed !Help for font selector dialogue box.</P>

<P>No longer bother to squash Messages and Sprite files.</P>

<P>Code to handle running on systems prior to RISC&nbsp;OS 3.1 removed for clarity.</P>

<P>More work to clean up source for open-source release.</P>

<P>Dropped optimised support for loading files directly from Z88 filing system
for clarity in source. It's much better for them to be copied off the Z88
first and then loaded into PipeDream.</P>

<P>Now works with Avisoft Reporter (when built with selected instrumentation).</P>


<H4>4.50/36 (31 Aug 2012)</H4>

<P>Eliminated a couple of MOVS pc, lr that fouled up on ARMv7 systems. Note
that there will always be a couple of 26-bit only instructions present in
the executable code as PipeDream's Escape and Event handlers are called in
26-bit or 32-bit mode on different systems
(e.g. RISC&nbsp;OS 4.39's 26-bit kernel and RISC&nbsp;OS 5.20's 32-bit kernel)
with the appropriate code being executed conditionally.</P>

<P>Low-level memory allocator changed to pre-RISC&nbsp;OS 5.18 compatible allocator
(from Fireworkz) that doesn't use OS_Heap SWIs to isolate from RISC&nbsp;OS 5.18
OS_Heap SWI changes. It's also faster due to no SWI overheads.</P>

<P>The character used in text @-fields may now be set to other than '@' in a
document's Options dialogue box. Important notes: this does not change any
existing text. When changing this character, all cells containing slot
reference text @-fields will need to be 'recompiled' to reflect this - the
easiest (and safest) way of doing this is to save the document and reload it
immediately after closing the Options dialogue box. Other text @-fields will
update immediately.</P>

<P>Dialogue boxes that have a Cancel button or are definitely always raised as
menus or submenus (e.g. About this program) no longer have a close icon (and
thereby possibly unwanted iconise icon) on the title bar. This was a
hangover from having always had to use a very, very old template editor
prior to using !WinEd.</P>

<P>Chart bar / line / pie / scatter galleries spruced up with higher res
sprites.</P>

<P>Can now directly import JPEG files.</P>

<P>New mode sprite bounding box correctly calculated using its dpi.</P>

<P>DragASprite in Save dialogue box now respects configuration set by !Boot.</P>

<P>Use ColourPicker module to select chart colours rather than old dboxtcol.</P>

<P>Uses 24-bit palette entries rather than copying nibbles a la RO2.</P>

<P>Eliminate redundant Draw groups in chart text objects.</P>

<P>Removed archaic Drawfile loading and rendering code from RISC_OSLib (saves
about 34KB; only renders using Drawfile module).</P>

<P>Begin merge of PipeDream's copy of RISC_OSLib with modern one from ROOL.</P>

<P>Allow matrix determinant to be calculated for larger sizes.</P>


<H4>4.50/35 (23 Mar 2012)</H4>

<P>Fully 32-bit-ised the muldiv64 assember code module for ARMv7.</P>

<P>Updated ImageSlot to 32-bit compatible version (same as used by Fireworkz)

<P>No longer require the very latest FPEmulator in !Run.</P>


<H4>4.50/34 (22 Mar 2012)</H4>

<P>Fixed spreadsheet array formula processing code that could crash PipeDream
(the new C compiler no longer concealed this bug!).</P>

<P>Fixed call to Wimp_SlotSize to save critcal regs around call (was corrupt).</P>

<P>Allow --no-dynamic-areas option to be set in PipeDream$$RunOptions to avoid
fragmenting address space on large memory systems (this is automatically
done in !Run for RISC&nbsp;OS 5).</P>

<P>Check for CallASWI module in !Run for new SharedCLibrary (CallASWI needs
loading on RISC&nbsp;OS 3.6 and below).</P>


<H4>4.50/33 (22 Mar 2012)</H4>

<P>Evaluator compiled without -Otime optimisation - crashed some stats sheets.</P>


<H4>4.50/32 (21 Mar 2012)</H4>

<P>Really! Has it been that long?

<P>First 32-bit release of PipeDream, built using RISC&nbsp;OS Open Limited C tools
release 20.</P>

<P>Registration number code and template info removed as the PipeDream
installer no longer generates one. Previous Info files may be used to show
user and organisation name in the splash screen and Info box.</P>


<H3>Release history (26-bit version)</H3>

<H4>4.50/23 (10 Aug 2000)</H4>

<P>PipeDream documents can now be saved with leafnames longer than 12
characters where this is allowed, e.g. RISC&nbsp;OS 4 new format hard discs,
ADFS E+/F+ format floppies and RAM discs. This may also work on earlier
systems with the Longnames module loaded or into archive files, but this has
not been tested.</P>

<P>PipeDream tested against RISC&nbsp;OS 4.02 (patch 3 release 2)</P>


<H4>4.50/22 (11 Apr 1999)</H4>

<P>Range over which COMBIN() and PERMUT() spreadsheet functions work
increased, avoiding integer overflow.</P>


<H4>4.50/21 (17 Jan 1999)</H4>

<P>^LAW (auto width) now works correctly again using marked blocks. This had
been broken since 4.50/08.</P>

<P>E format numbers in chart axes no longer contain superfluous commas.</P>

<P>@C:r,g,b@ can be used to set the colour of the following text on a line
(only when using fonts and RISC&nbsp;OS 3.5 or later) e.g. aaa@C:240,0,0@bbb would
display aaa followed by bbb in red. Use @C@ to restore normal (black).</P>
Versions prior to this one will display the full @ sequence instead of the
colour change.</P>

<P>Caters for loading Squashed Messages, Sprites, Sprites22.</P>

<P>Superfluous !Help file removed from Resources directory; PipeDream always
uses the one from the main !PipeDream directory, as does the RISC&nbsp;OS Filer.</P>

<P>First full (i.e. non-upgrade) version of PipeDream 4.5 released.</P>


<H4>4.50/20 (14 Nov 1998)</H4>

<P>Bug whereby 31.12.2000 displayed as 01.01.2001 fixed.</P>

<P>Save file as paragraph type no longer forces paragraph separator to LF.</P>

<P>Tristate icons (don't care / yes / no choice) now work correctly.</P>


<H4>4.50/14 (12 Jan 1998)</H4>

<P>Dialogue boxes dynamically modified on RISC&nbsp;OS 3.1 to use menu-type icons
no longer force an explicit ESG (used to set ESG 15) to avoid unsetting
radio buttons in the dialogue box. The templates have been modified to
accommodate this.</P>


<H4>4.50/13 (13 Nov 1997)</H4>

<P>Thin grid lines are now printed again using a default line width of zero.</P>
In order to get round various printer driver faults you may need to add an
extra argument into the last line of !PipeDream.!Run so that it reads:

<P>Run &lt;PipeDream$$ImageDir&gt;.Resource.Image -k 64 %*0

<P>where the number after -k is the desired line thickness in Draw units
(there are 256 of these per OS unit), 64 being the value previously
hard-coded in v4.50/10 - v4.50/12. You may need to make this number larger
or smaller depending on the particular printer driver you use.</P>


<H4>4.50/12 (10 Nov 1997)</H4>

<P>Entering a date with a two digit year is how handled using a sliding window
about the present year such that it yields a year in the range now-70 < year
&lt;= now+30. This also applies to the DATE() and DATEVALUE() spreadsheet
functions.</P>

<P>Dialogue boxes now dynamically modified on RISC&nbsp;OS 3.1 to use menu-type
icons with R1 effect rather than standard R6,3 action buttons in order to
work around the RISC&nbsp;OS 3.1 Window Manager problem where the Window Manager
would try to redraw an icon in a dialogue box that no longer exists.</P>


<H4>4.50/11 (08 Sep 1997)</H4>

<P>Sassoon.Primary now changes to Sassoon.Bold when bold highlight is used.</P>

<P>Delete Row In Column now sets file modified.</P>

<P>PROPER("o'connor") spreadsheet function now correctly returns "O'Connor".</P>

<P>PROPER("barnes-wallis") spreadsheet function now correctly returns "Barnes-Wallis".</P>

<P>VALUE() spreadsheet function fixed to return 0 when presented with input that doesn't
yield a numeric result.</P>


<H4>4.50/10 (28 May 1997)</H4>

<P>PipeDream now claims an extra 4KB of stack memory whilst starting up in
order to prevent itself running out of memory whilst starting to print when
this is invoked from the button bar.</P>

<P>You can now raise negative numbers to odd fractional powers e.g. (-8)^(1/3)
will find the cube root of two - in fact the cube root with zero imaginary
part.</P>

<P>Thin grid lines are now printed using a very small (but non-zero) line
width in order to get round some printer driver faults.</P>


<H4>4.50/09 (27 Jan 1997)</H4>

<P>PipeDream now claims an extra 32KB of memory before starting to print in
order to prevent itself running out of memory whilst printing.</P>


<H4>4.50/08 (17 Jan 1997)</H4>

<P>Ctrl-TAB and Shift-Ctrl-TAB when text is in the editing line didn't enter
the text into the edited slot before moving.</P>

<P>Manual axis settings now override any automatically calculated limits. Data
values beyond the min/max axis values are now clipped at the min/max axis
values.</P>

<P>Cumulative bar/line charts now add in negative values rather than ignoring
them.</P>

<P>^BRP now enters the Search & Replace dialogue box with the replace option
already checked.</P>

<P>Borders removed from icons in Chart-&gt;Selection-&gt;Series dialogue box.</P>

<P>Chart-&gt;Selection-&gt;Fill style dialogue box now displays file name correctly.</P>

<P>MONTHNAME() spreadsheet function corrected (was one month out).</P>

<P>row number alignment now behaves the same on all systems.</P>


<H4>4.50/07 (08 Jan 1997)</H4>

<P>Colour inversion handling in &gt; 256 colour modes should now be right: it
used to sometimes leave 'droppings' of previously marked areas temporarily
greyed out on the document.</P>

<P>Spell check word inversion should now work in &gt; 256 colour modes.</P>

<P>No longer keeps bringing dialogue boxes to the front so that BubbleHelp
throbs less when pointing at a PipeDream dialogue box.</P>

<P>Recalc number (and column width indicator) now lines up properly.</P>

<P>The document window with the input focus now changes properly to the input
focus colour.</P>


<H4>4.50/06 (01 Dec 1996)</H4>

<P>WEEKNUMBER() spreadsheet function added.</P>

<P>@D@ now outputs century prefix in English/American format as well as Text.</P>

<P>@F:x[,y]@ now accepted as way of performing font size change without
changing font too.</P>

<P>Call to Font_ScanString fixed so super/subscripts display correctly.</P>

<P>Residual debugging information removed from release version.</P>


<H4>4.50/05 (27 Nov 1996)</H4>

<P>Handles PD4.5(old) -&gt; PD4.5(new) upgrade.</P>

<P>Handles PD3 upgrade much smoother.</P>

<P>Problem whereby sheet data and protection state was corrupted when sorting
the contents of a file with Dynamic area handling in use fixed.</P>

<P>Sliders in colour selector dialogue boxes now display correctly.</P>

<P>Word count now displays correctly.</P>

<P>Text/English/American date display option fixed.</P>

<P>Justify button now correctly updates internal state.</P>

<P>Factorials more accurately calculated for larger n.</P>

<P>Formula window selections now invert correctly in &gt;= 256 colour modes.</P>


<H2>User Interface changes since 4.13</H2>

<P>PipeDream now has a revised toolbar, bringing quick access to many useful
(both existing and new) functions. Each tool button responds to help
requests, so it may be useful to run !Help for a while to get used to what
each button can do for you. !BubbleHelp (available from David Pilling) is a
most excellent replacement for !Help and works well with PipeDream.</P>

<P>When PipeDream is loaded in a high resolution screen mode, it loads its set
of high resolution sprites for better on-screen appearance. Low resolution
sprites are still available for use by (and selected automatically for)
users who are not running in such screen modes.</P>

<P>Clicking SELECT on the iconbar icon now invites the user to create a
document using a template; the old default document create is available by
clicking ADJUST on the iconbar icon.</P>

<P>Save dialogue boxes now use DragASprite to enhance the appearance of
dragging the file icon.</P>

<P>Double click on column adjuster now performs the Auto Width command.</P>

<P>Do command file function enhanced to list command files which are in the
same directory as the selected document.</P>

<P>Column and row numbers now position themselves correctly on RISC PCs.</P>

<P>Full screen window toggle now works correctly on RISC PCs.</P>

<P>Menus now align their shortcuts correctly on RISC PCs.</P>


<H2>Other changes since 4.13</H2>

<P>Dynamic area storage for PipeDream file data implemented. This speeds up
task swapping on RISC PCs considerably, and permits the use of Clares'
Virtualise to have documents loaded which are bigger than physical memory.</P>

<P>PipeDream now responds to the Desktop save protocol and so can be reloaded
automatically on restarting the machine.</P>

<P>PipeDream uses the Acorn Drawfile renderer on systems where this is loaded
and hence can render JPEGs on RISC&nbsp;OS 3.7 systems.</P>

<P>@G@ Draw file references can now take the form:</P>

<PRE>
@G:&lt;draw file name&gt;,&lt;x scale factor&gt;,&lt;y scale factor&gt;@
</PRE>

<P> (this only works if the Drawfile module is loaded)</P>

<P>PipeDream now iconises to the Pinboard correctly.</P>

<P>Kerning in outline fonts implemented. See the Options dialogue box.</P>

<P>Messages and sprites are no longer bound to the PipeDream !RunImage.</P>

<P>Clear Block function added.</P>

<P>Make number/Make text functions added.</P>


<H2>Functions added since 4.50/00</H2>

<H4>BIN(<I>array1</I>, <I>array2</I>)</H4>

<P><I>array2</I> defines a set of 'bins' into which the data of <I>array1</I> is counted.</P>

<P>For example, if array2 is {20,40,60,80}, the returned array gives the
number of elements of array1 whose value satisfies value&lt;=20, 20<value&lt;=40,
40&lt;value&lt;=60, 60&lt;=value&lt;=80 and finally value&gt;80. The returned array will
therefore always have one more element than array2. Neither array need be
sorted.</P>

<P>One use of this function is to organise data for making a histogram.</P>

<P>For example, with data in A1A100, and bin categories in B1B5, the
following formula would provide the basis for a bar chart:</P>

<PRE>
SET_VALUE(C1C6, BIN(A1A100, B1B5))
</PRE>

<P>You would then make a bar chart from the range B1 to C6, using column B as
labels.</P>

<H4>FLIP(<I>array</I>)</H4>

<P>Swaps rows about the middle row of an <I>array</I>.</P>

<P>e.g. {1;2;3} becomes {3;2;1}

<H4>FORMULA_TEXT(<I>cell_reference</I>)</H4>

<P>Returns as a string the formula in the cell referenced, so that it can be
displayed in the worksheet. This is useful for annotating worksheets, and
printing out the formula which created the results shown in the worksheet.</P>

<H4>MEDIAN(<I>array</I>)</H4>

<P>Returns the median value in the (not necessarily sorted) range.</P>

<P>If there are an even number of values in the range, the mean of the two
middle values is returned.</P>

<H4>RANK(<I>array</I>{,<I>spearflag</I>})</H4>

<P>Takes an <I>array</I> and ranks the values it contains, producing as an output an
array with two columns { <I>rank</I>, <I>entries</I> }, where</P>

<P><I>Rank</I> is the rank of each value (from highest to lowest).</P>

<P><I>Entries</I> contains the number of entries of that value in the input array.</P>

<P>If <I>spearflag</I> is present and is non-zero, equally ranked entries are
adjusted so that the output is suitable for passing to the SPEARMAN() rank
correlation function.</P>

<H4>SORT(<I>array</I>, <I>number</I>)</H4>

<P>Sorts the rows in the <I>array</I> in ascending order based on the values in
column <I>number</I>.</P>

<P>For example, SORT(B1E100,2) sorts rows 1..100 based on the contents of
column C.</P>

<P>Use with FLIP() to sort in descending order.</P>

<P>Use with TRANSPOSE() to sort by column based on values in rows.</P>

<H4>SPEARMAN(<I>array1</I>, <I>array2</I>)</H4>

<P>Returns the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for the two arrays.</P>

<P>The input <I>array</I>s can be taken from the RANK() function.</P>

<H4>TEXT(<I>number</I>, <I>string</I>)</H4>

<P>Returns a string of the <I>number</I> in the style specified. This allows
formatted results other than those provided by PipeDream's style system.</P>

<P><I>number</I> may be a number or a date.</P>

<P><I>string</I> is a format string in Fireworkz number format style.</P>

<P>Please refer to the Fireworkz Spreadsheet Guide for details. For example,</P>

<P>TEXT(1234.567, "$#,###.00") returns $1,234.57</P>

<P>TEXT(1234.567, "g0.###\m") returns 1.235km</P>


<H2>Functions added since 4.13</H2>

<H4>AGE(</I>date1</I>, </I>date2</I>)</H4>

<P>Works out the difference between two dates in years and months.
<I>date1</I> should be the more recent date, and <I>date2</I> the earlier date.</P>

<P>For example:</P>

<P>AGE(26.6.1994, 25.8.1982)</P>

<P>returns the age as a number, expressed as 12.10, that is, someone aged 12
years and 10 months.</P>

<P>Use INT() to extract the number of years from the result and 100*(n-INT(n))
to extract the number of months.</P>

<H4>COMBIN(<I>n</I>, <I>k</I>)</H4>

<P><I>n</I>C<I>k</I> = <I>n</I>! / ((<I>n</I>-<I>k</I>)! <I>k</I>!)</P>

<P>This function yields the number of combinations of <I>n</I> unlike things
taken <I>k</I> at a time.</P>

<H4>DAYNAME(<I>number</I>|<I>date</I>)</H4>

<P>Returns a day name string corresponding to the <I>number</I> or
<I>date</I> (where Sunday is day one).</P>

<H4>FACT(n)</H4>

<P>This function yields the factorial of </>n</I> (most commonly shortened
to <I>n</I>!). <I>n</I> must be an integer greater than or equal to zero. 
If <I>n</I> &lt; 12, the result is an integer, else it is floating point.</P>

<H4>MONTHNAME(<I>number</I>|<I>date</I>)</H4>

<P>Returns a month name string corresponding to the <I>number</I> or
<I>date</I> (where January is month one).</P>

<H4>PERMUT(<I>n</I>, <I>k</I>)</H4>

<P><I>n</I>P<I>k</I> = <I>n</I>! / (<I>n</I>-<I>k</I>)!

<P>This function yields the number of permutations of <I>n</I> unlike things
taken <I>k</I> at a time.</P>

<H4>WEEKNUMBER(<I>date</I>)</H4>

<P>Returns the week number corresponding to the <I>date</I>.</P>

<H2>Warnings</H2>

<P>When using Virtualise or a similar virtual memory manager on RISC PCs,
install Virtualise *before* you load in PipeDream. This is because
PipeDream optimises its memory handling differently when VM is active on its
area - the only way it knows this is by comparing the maximum size of the
area with what it should be were VM not active i.e. Virtualise must have
been allowed to alter the maximum size of an area before PipeDream loads in.</P>


<H2>Resources</H2>

<P>Templates are grouped by menu:</P>

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

<P>NB To help design-time icon alignment, most icons in PipeDream's template
files have the border flag applied, which is then stripped off at run-time.</P>


<H2>Known problems in this release</H2>

<P>It is still possible (since PipeDream 3) to create circular dependencies
in @slot_ref@ chains which fail to complete calculation.</P>

<P>Stack overflows which should raise(SIGSTAK) instead give 'Uncaught trap'.</P>

<P>LISTCOUNT() function has not been successfully backported from Fireworkz.</P>

<P>Pressing ESCAPE whilst dragging a file somewhere to be saved may sometimes
cause a Data Abort.</P>

<P>There is a problem whereby a document does not reload a newly created chart
properly. If an chart is created and a copy of the chart is saved out as a
drawfile (with a different name) then the chart will not reload after being
closed down. It will reload successfully if PipeDream is restarted.</P>

<P>Exporting charts directly to other applications (e.g. EasyWriter) as Draw
files via the Message_RAMFetch / Message_RAMTransfer mechanism only works if
the application being exported to asks for the whole file in one go as the
protocol is stopped by PipeDream after the first Message_RAMFetch is
responded to.</P>


<H2>32-bit !System</H2>

<P>Please note that the latest distribution of !System for use with pre-RISC
OS 5 machines may be found on the RISC&nbsp;OS Open website at:</P>

<P><A HREF="https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/other-zipfiles">https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/other-zipfiles</A></P>

<p>under the heading:</P>

<P><B>System resources</B></P>

<P>NB Do NOT use the merge dialogue in</P>

<P> !Boot &gt; Configuration &gt; System Merge</P>

<P>because part of the update must refresh files in a directory that the merge
dialogue cannot reach. Instead, a simple obey file is included called
!SysMerge. Just double click on !SysMerge.</P>
