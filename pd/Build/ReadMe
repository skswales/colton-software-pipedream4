Prerequisites
-------------

Acorn C/C++ Release 25 or later (!Amu, C compiler, headers, libraries, linker).

InfoZip (install with PackMan) for creating a zip of the final build.

A RISC OS CVS client to download a copy of RISC_OSLib.

patch (install with PackMan) to patch that copy of RISC_OSLib for use with
PipeDream.


First-time configuration and build
----------------------------------

Ensure that the system has 'seen' AcornC/C++ and set that environment.

Run !!!Boot to set up the PipeDream build environment.

Run configure to create the build directories.

You need to then check out and build a pruned and patched variant of
RISC_OSLib with PipeDream-specific build options. See ^.WimpLib.ReadMe and
^.WimpLib.external.RISC_OSLib.ReadMe for instructions on how to do this.

Run !Amu.

Drag 'r32.Makefile' to !Amu... and wait...  A PipeDream build takes
about 16 minutes on a SA RISC PC.  Building on an ARMX6 takes about
one minute.


Subsequent builds
-----------------

After any reboot, you will need to:

Ensure that the system has 'seen' AcornC/C++ and set that environment.

Run !!!Boot to set up the PipeDream build environment.

Run !Amu.

Drag 'r32.Makefile' to !Amu... and wait...


Creating a package for distribution
----------------------------------- 

Make sure you've got the version number consistent! See version.c for notes.

Execute the Obey file r32.MakeRiscPkg.

This will copy only those files needed for distribution to PipeDream_4_xx_yy
in $.Temp and create the corresponding distributable ZIP package file.
