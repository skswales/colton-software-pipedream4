    <h1>PipeDream 4 — Mouse operations</h1>
    <p>
        This gives a summary of the mouse operations available in PipeDream 4.
        It is intended as a reminder rather than an exhaustive reference.
        For more information refer to the section called Caret Movements in the <em>Reference Guide</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Many of these mouse operations are described interactively in the RISC OS Help application when used in conjunction with PipeDream 4.</p>

    <h2>Opening a Pipedream document window</h2>
    <p>To open a new PipeDream document window, click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> on the PipeDream 4 icon on the icon bar.</p>

    <h2>Bringing up menus and choosing commands</h2>
    <p>With the pointer in a PipeDream window, click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> to bring up the top level menu.</p>
    <p>To bring up a sub-menu, drag the pointer over the arrow to the right of the menu name.</p>
    <p>
        To choose a command, click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> on the command name.
        This carries out the command and removes the menu from the screen.
        If you click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span>, the menu remains on the screen.
    </p>

    <h2>Loading documents</h2>
    <p>To load a PipeDream document, either double-click on its icon, or drag its icon onto the Pipedream icon on the icon bar.</p>
    <p>To insert a file at the caret position, drag the file's icon into the window.</p>

    <h2>Positioning the caret</h2>
    <p>
        Always use the <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> button to position the caret within cells.
        Normally the caret will be positioned in the cell you are pointing at.
        However, if there is a text cell to the left of the cell you are pointing at,
        PipeDream will position the caret in the cell to the left.
        This prevents you accidentally typing in columns to the right of where you expected.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you really want to position the caret to the right of a text cell, hold down <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> when you click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span>.
        Alternatively a single click in the column border will move the caret into that column.
    </p>

    <h2>Marking blocks</h2>
    <p>To mark a block, hold down <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> and drag from the top-left of the block to the bottom right.</p>
    <p>To mark complete columns, drag <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> across the column borders.</p>
    <p>To mark complete rows, drag <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> down the row borders.</p>
    <p>To mark one complete row, double-click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> in the row border.</p>
    <p>To mark one complete column, double-click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> in the column border.</p>
    <p>To mark the whole document, click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> in the Mark Block box at the intersection of the row and column borders.</p>
    <p>To clear any marked block, click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> in the Mark Block box at the intersection of the row and column borders.</p>
    <p>
        To adjust a marked block after marking it, move the pointer to the point at which you now want the block to end and click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span>.
        The marked block will now end where you click.
        The starting point will remain the same.
    </p>

    <h2>Scrolling the window</h2>
    <h3>Up and down</h3>
    <p>
        Position the pointer on the scroll arrow and click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> to scroll one line in the direction of the arrow.
        Hold down <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> to continue scrolling.
        Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> to scroll in the other direction.
        The caret always remains within the PipeDream window, staying as near as possible to its original position.
    </p>
    <p>
        Position the pointer on the darker part of the scroll bar
        (above the slider to scroll up, below the slider to scroll down) and click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span>.
        The next windowful of the document will appear.
        Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> to scroll back the other way.
        The caret always remains within the PipeDream window, moving, if necessary, to the point nearest to its position before scrolling.
    </p>
    <p>To move a long distance up or down drag the slider in the vertical scroll bar.</p>

    <h3>Left and right</h3>
    <p>Click on the left and right arrows in the horizontal scroll bars to move one column left or right.</p>
    <p>Click in the dark grey area of the scroll bar to move the window one windowful left or right.</p>
    <p>To move a long distance left or right drag the slider in the horizontal scroll bar.</p>

    <h2>Entering cell references into the editing line</h2>
    <p>
        To enter a cell reference into the editing line whilst you are editing an expression, click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> in the cell.
        The cell can be in the current window or in another, in which case you will insert an external reference.
