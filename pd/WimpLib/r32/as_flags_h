; "No26bitCode" means don't rely on 26-bit instructions
; (eg TEQP and LDM ^) - the code will work on 32-bit systems.

; "No32bitCode" means don't rely on 32-bit instructions
; (eg MSR and MRS) - the code will work on RISC OS 3.1.

; Setting both to {TRUE} is too much for the macros to cope with -
; you will have to use run-time code as shown below.
