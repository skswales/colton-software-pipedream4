The WimpLib library is a variant of RISC_OSLib with particular adaptations
for use with PipeDream.  It MUST be built using a pruned and patched copy of
a specific version of RISC_OSLib, NOT the one on your RISC_OSLib: path!

See WimpLib.external.RISC_OSLib.ReadMe for the steps you need to take before
building WimpLib.

Then drag WimpLib.r32.Makefile to !Amu.
