Note that any files that appear in this directory or any subdirectory
thereof as a result of checking out, pruning and patching a copy of
RISC_OSLib are NOT covered by the above licence.

Many WimpLib source files are *pruned* and *patched* copies of files from
RISC_OSLib from RISC OS Open.

To create, first acquire a RISC OS git client (install Simplegit-Libgit2 with PackMan).

Run rlib_git_co to checkout the RiscOS/Sources/Lib/RISC_OSLib
component from ROOL.

Run rlib_patch.apply to copy just the files that PipeDream needs to build
WimpLib and apply the required set of patches.

NB VerIntern is just placed at the top level, one up from normal, to
simplify PipeDream's include path.

Once you've done that you may wish to move the 'gitlab' directory to some
reference location to save space & speed find results
