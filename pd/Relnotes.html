<h4>4.61 (12 Dec 2022)</h4>

<p>Engineering format for the TEXT() spreadsheet function updated to match
Resolution 3 of the 27th CGPM (2022) - 'On the extension of the range of SI prefixes'.
This adds the following to the list of SI prefixes to be used for multiples and submultiples of units:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Q : 10^30</li>
<li>R : 10^27</li>
<li>r : 10^-27</li>
<li>q : 10^-30</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to this release, PipeDream used prefixes that had been proposed by Jeff K. Aronson in the 1990s for these multiples and submultiples,
with the prefixes W, X, x, w corresponding to the new prefixes Q, R, r, q.</p>

<p>Several redundant RISC_OSLib functions removed; some others replaced with inline ASM blocks.</p>

<p>Interactive Help messages more consistent with RISC OS User and Style Guides.</p>

<p>'PipeDream 4' used more throughout to discriminate vs PipeDream 3.</p>


<h4>4.60.03 (23 Oct 2022)</h4>

<p>Cosmetic fixes for menu and toolbar icons running on RISC OS 3.1.</p>

<p>HTML documentation now encoded as UTF-8.</p>


<h4>4.60.02 (18 Aug 2022)</h4>

<p>PipeDream no longer attempts to parse expressions as ISO 8601 format
date / times as this was messing up several users' existing spreadsheets.
The DATEVALUE() spreadsheet function does still recognise such dates.</p>

<p>CSV file loading no longer parses number fields as expressions. Dates
such as 2022-08-18 are inserted as text rather than as a formula. This means
that if you have a CSV file with a column of dates in ISO 8601 format, they
can be loaded unchanged and then converted to usable dates using the
DATEVALUE() spreadsheet function.</p>

<p>Fix for dragging an icon from the Save dialogue box when the file type
icon is not present in the Wimp Sprite Pool (e.g. TSV) - as elsewhere, the
generic file_xxx icon is now used for solid drag in these cases.</p>


<h4>4.60.01 (04 Aug 2022)</h4>

<p>Loader and Splash had incorrect file types in 4.60 due to a packaging error.</p>


<h4>4.60 (22 Jul 2022)</h4>

<p>PipeDream can import tab-separated-value files of type TSV (&amp;F0D).</p>

<p>The international currency symbol (&curren;: &amp;A4) can be used in the
leading (or trailing - but not in both) characters definition string, where
it is substituted during rendering with the appropriate currency string read
from the Territory Manager (e.g. &pound; in the UK).</p>

<p>The default leading characters string is now &curren; rather than &pound;.</p>

<p>An empty default locale is set during startup so that the system default
locale is used wherever possible by the SharedCLibrary functions, using the
Territory Manager. This may be overridden by editing
 <code>!PipeDream.!Run</code> and adding
 <code>-l &lt;locale-specifier&gt;</code> to the PipeDream command line.</p>

<p>Pressing Ctrl whilst clicking the Up icon in dialogue boxes may be used
to set the value in the adjacent field to its maximum allowed value (or to
the start of the list of values). Similarly, Ctrl-Down may be used to set
the minimum allowed value (or to the end of the list of values).</p>

<p>Numbers typed in the formula line (or imported from CSV files) with only
trailing zeros immediately behind the decimal point (e.g. 1.0) are no longer
immediately converted to integers for subsequent calculation, display or
saving but now remain as floating point values (with zero fractional
part).</p>

<p>Interactive Help messages more consistent between row and column
borders.</p>

<p><code>SWI Portable_Idle</code> is called during pausing when printing to
screen.</p>

<p>More consistent use of https:// vs. http:// in URLs.</p>

<p>ROOL DDE 30d build environment used.</p>


    <h2 id="KnownProblems">Known Problems In This Release</h2>

    <p>
        It is still possible (and has been since PipeDream 3) to create circular
        dependencies in @cell_ref@ chains which fail to complete calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pressing ESCAPE whilst dragging a file somewhere to be saved may
        sometimes cause a Data Abort.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a problem whereby a document does not reload a newly created
        chart properly. If an chart is created and a copy of the chart is saved out
        as a Draw file (with a different name) then the chart will not reload after
        being closed down. It will reload successfully if PipeDream is
        restarted.
    </p>

    <p>
        Exporting charts directly to other applications (e.g. EasyWriter) as Draw
        files via the Message_RAMFetch / Message_RAMTransfer mechanism only works if
        the application being exported to asks for the whole file in one go as the
        protocol is stopped by PipeDream after the first Message_RAMFetch is
        responded to.
    </p>


    <h2>32-bit !System</h2>

        pre-RISC OS 5 computers may be found on the RISC OS Open web site at:
