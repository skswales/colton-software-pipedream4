<h1>HotLinks</h1>

<p>PipeDream HotLinks enable PipeDream and other applications to share data
dynamically. For example, you can create a spreadsheet in PipeDream, link
PipeDream to a spreadsheet charts program; the charts program can then draw a
chart based on the PipeDream spreadsheet and update it dynamically. You can, of
course, use PipeDream to create charts for you dynamically. However, you may
want to use another charts program to create the particular type of chart which
interests you and which PipeDream does not support.</p>

<p>The way in which you use HotLinks depends on the other application, but is
usually very simple. Using HotLinks Presenter from Lingenuity, for example,you
would:</p>

<p>1. Create your spreadsheet in PipeDream.</p>

<p>2. Install HotLinks Presenter on the icon bar.</p>

<p>3. In PipeDream, mark the part of the spreadsheet from which you want to
produce a chart.</p>

<p>4. Click Select on the New Link option in Presenter's icon menu. This
establishes the link between the two programs and passes the initial data from
PipeDream to Presenter.</p>

<p>5. In HotLinks Presenter, create the chart you require.</p>

<p>6. In PipeDream, edit the data until you are happy with it. Any changes you
make to the data in PipeDream are automatically reflected in Presenter's
chart.</p>

<p>Another HotLinks package is HotLinks GraphBox from Minerva. For details of
HotLinks Presenter, HotLinks GraphBox and other HotLinks packages, contact
Lingenuity and Minerva directly.</p>

<p>HotLinks extend PipeDream's scope by enabling you to share data with other
software. However, you will probably find it easier to create charts from your
spreadsheets inside PipeDream. Of course, PipeDream's own charts are
HotLinked. Also, if you create and edit the charts purely within PipeDream, you
have more facilities to help you incorporate the chart within your document and
ensure that the chart automatically restarts when you reload the document. As
in other areas, it is usually easier to edit your data within PipeDream rather
than with two separate editors.</p>
