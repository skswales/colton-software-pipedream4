    <h1>About This Guide</h1>
    <p>
        This <em>Getting Started Guide</em> is designed to give you an overall feel for how to use PipeDream by taking you
        through several examples which you can try out on the computer as you are reading.
        The examples deal separately with word processing, spreadsheet use and database use before a
        final example demonstrates PipeDream&rsquo;s unique capacity to combine the different sorts of work.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have used PipeDream before or are an experienced user of other word processors, spreadsheets or database programs
        we recommend that you glance through the appropriate chapters before moving on to the <a href="../../RefGuide/index.html">Reference Guide</a>.
        You will probably encounter features of PipeDream which are new to you and
        you will get a feel for how PipeDream differs from software that you have used before.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you haven&rsquo;t used this type of software before, we recommend that you work through all of the examples in the <em>Getting Started Guide</em>.
        As you do so, you will leam a lot about the different types of work PipeDream can help you with.
        You will almost certainly discover ways of doing things which you hadn&rsquo;t imagined were possible.
        Whilst most people try to avoid reading software documentation if they can,
        a little extra time spent studying now can save you a lot of time later on.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="gloss.htm">Glossary</a> gives a non-technical explanation of those terms
        used throughout the <em>Getting Started Guide</em> which you may not have come across before.
    </p>
    <p>
        The PipeDream <a href="../../RefGuide/index.html">Reference Guide</a> is designed for
        more experienced users who know what they want to do, but need to be able to look up the details.
