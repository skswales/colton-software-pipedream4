    <h1>About This Guide</h1>
    <p>
        This <em>Getting Started Guide</em> is designed to give you an overall feel for how to use PipeDream 4 by taking you
        through several examples which you can try out on the computer as you are reading.
        The examples deal separately with word processing, spreadsheet use and database use before a
        final example demonstrates PipeDream 4’s unique capacity to combine the different sorts of work.
    </p>
