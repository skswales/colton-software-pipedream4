    <h1>Commands</h1>
    <p>
        PipeDream can perform a number of operations called commands.
        Commands enable you to move around within your PipeDream document windows and edit your data.
        They can be given by means of menus or directly from the keyboard.
    </p>

    <h2>Menus</h2>
    <p>
        Bring up the PipeDream main menu by clicking <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> (the middle mouse button).
        The pointer must be within the PipeDream document window when you do this.
    </p>
    <p>The PipeDream main menu is a list of the menus available in PipeDream.</p>
    <p>
        As you will see, each of the items on the PipeDream main menu has an arrow to the right.
        This means that each has its own sub-menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        To choose the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu, for example,
        move the pointer onto the <span class="csg-menu-option">Edit</span> option,
        then slide it over the arrow on the right.
        The <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu will appear.
    </p>
    <p>The <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu, like the other PipeDream menus, is a list of commands.</p>
    <p>
        If you don&rsquo;t want to use the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu, simply move the pointer back onto the main menu.
        The <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu disappears and you can make another choice from the main menu.
        If you want to get rid of the main menu, click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> anywhere outside the menu (or press <span class="csg-key">Escape</span>).
        The main menu will disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
        Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> again to bring up the PipeDream main menu.
        Move the pointer onto the <span class="csg-menu-option">Blocks</span> option,
        then slide it over the arrow on the right to bring up the <span class="csg-menu">Blocks</span> menu.
        You will see that many commands on the <span class="csg-menu">Blocks</span> menu have an arrow to the right.
        This means that you need to move the pointer over the arrow to see something else before you can carry out the command.
        This will usually be a dialogue box, although it may be a window providing information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move the pointer onto the <span class="csg-menu-option">Search</span> command, for example,
        then slide it over the arrow immediately to the right.
        The <span class="csg-dbox">Search</span> dialogue box will appear.
    </p>

    <h2>Dialogue Boxes</h2>
    <p>
        A dialogue box is a window used to specify information before carrying out a command.
        Some dialogue boxes contain boxes where you type in information.
        In the <span class="csg-dbox">Search</span> dialogue box, for example,
        there is a box where you can type in the word for which you want to search.
        For the moment, simply move the pointer back onto the <span class="csg-menu">Blocks</span> menu.
        The <span class="csg-dbox">Search</span> dialogue box will disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some dialogue boxes list options from which you make a selection.
        Move the pointer onto the <span class="csg-menu-option">Save as</span> command on the <span class="csg-menu">Files</span> menu, then move it over the arrow.
        You will see the <span class="csg-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move the pointer onto the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Save only marked block</span> option and click.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will see an &lsquo;on&rsquo; indicator appear in the icon next to the option.
        This means that the option has been turned on.
        Click the option again to turn it off.
        This kind of &lsquo;on / off&rsquo; option is called a check box.
    </p>
    <p>
        Look at the bottom of the <span class="csg-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box.
        Here, there are several <span class="csg-dbox-option">Format</span> options, each with a icon next to it.
        The icon next to the <span class="csg-dbox-option">PipeDream</span> option has an &lsquo;on&rsquo; (filled) indicator within it
        to show that the <span class="csg-dbox-option">PipeDream</span> option is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move the pointer over the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Text</span> option and click.
        The indicator next to the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Text option</span> will now have the &lsquo;on&rsquo; indicator within it
        and that next to the <span class="csg-dbox-option">PipeDream</span> option will be &lsquo;off&rsquo; (empty).
        Now click the <span class="csg-dbox-option">PipeDream</span> option again.
        These kind of options, where only one option from a group may be selected at once, are called radio buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes you are given a restricted range of possibilities to choose from.
        Move the pointer to the up-arrow icon after the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Line separator</span> option and click.
        The item in the box on the right changes as you click.
        The same happens, but in the opposite direction, if you click on the down-arrow icon.
    </p>
    <p>When you have completed your dialogue box entries, you would click the appropriate action button, e.g. the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Save</span></span> button.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> on the action button,
            the command is carried out and the dialogue box disappears.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> on the action button,
            the command is carried out and the dialogue box remains on the screen.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pressing <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span> has the same effect as clicking <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> on the default action button.</p>
    <p>For the moment, don&rsquo;t click on <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Save</span></span> or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>.</p>
    <p>
        If you want to abandon a dialogue box, and not execute the command,
        click the <span class="csg-dbox-button">Cancel</span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Escape</span>).
    </p>

    <h2>Moving around the dialogue box</h2>
    <p>To move between the input fields in the dialogue box either use the mouse to click in the desired field or press <span class="csg-key">Tab</span> or <span class="csg-key">Shift-Tab</span>.</p>
    <p>Move the pointer back onto the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu.</p>
    <p>
        You will see that some of the commands on this menu do not have arrows after their names.
        This means that you can carry out the command directly from the menu,
        without needing to make any further choices or supply any more information.
        To do so, move the pointer onto the command and click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span>.
    </p>
    <p>The command will be carried out and the menu will disappear.</p>
    <p>
        If you click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> on a command, the command will be carried out but the menu will remain on the screen
        ready for you to select another command or repeat the previous one.
    </p>

    <h2>Keys</h2>
    <p>You can also use the key combinations shown on the menus.</p>
    <p>For example, to insert the date, you have the choice of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            choosing the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu and selecting the
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Insert date</span> command by moving the pointer onto it
            and then sliding it over the arrow to the right;
        </li>
        <li>pressing <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-D</span> .</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Function keys</h2>
    <p>For convenience, some commands have been assigned to the function keys, so that they can be given with a single key press.</p>
    <p>The function keys assigned to commands are shown on menus after the command&rsquo;s name.</p>

    <p>
        As you can see, PipeDream provides several methods of giving commands.
        It is entirely up to you which method you use.
        Some people use one method all the time; others use a combination of all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout this <em>Getting Started Guide</em> and the <em>Reference Guide</em>,
        the various methods will generally be shown as follows and it is up to you which method you use:
    </p>
    <table class="csg-command-table">
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-menu">Menu</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-command">Command</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-tool">Tool</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-key">Key</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-cmdseq">Cmd-sequence</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>File</td>
                <td>Save</td>
                <td><img src="images/toolbar/save.png" alt="Save icon" /></td>
                <td><span class="csg-key">F3</span></td>
                <td><span class="csg-cmdseq">FS</span></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>In the above case, for example, you could do one of the following:</p>
    <p><em>Either:</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> to bring up the PipeDream main menu.</li>
        <li>
            Move the pointer onto the <span class="csg-menu-option">File</span> option and then
            slide it over the arrow to display the <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu.
        </li>
        <li>Click the <span class="csg-menu-option">Save</span> command.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Or:</em></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>Press the <img src="images/toolbar/save.png" alt="Save icon" />&nbsp;button on the toolbar.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Or:</em></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>Press function key <span class="csg-key">F3</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Or:</em></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>Press <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span>-<span class="csg-key">\</span> followed by <span class="csg-key">F</span><span class="csg-key">S</span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Icon Menu</h2>
    <p>The <span class="csg-menu">Icon</span> menu is displayed by clicking <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> (the middle mouse button) on the PipeDream icon on the icon bar.</p>

    <h2>Short Menus and Long Menus</h2>
    <p>When you first start using PipeDream, the menus you see are short menus, which display the most frequently used commands.</p>
    <p>
        If you bring up the <span class="csg-menu">Icon</span> menu and slide off the <span class="csg-menu-option">Choices</span> option,
        you will see that the <span class="csg-menu-option">Short menus</span> command has a tick next to it.
        This shows that short menus are switched on.
        Move the pointer onto the <span class="csg-menu-option">Short menus</span> option and click.
        Note that the menu will disappear even if you click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> as you have asked for the menus to be modified.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you bring up the <span class="csg-menu">Icon</span> menu and slide off the <span class="csg-menu-option">Choices</span> option again,
        you will see that the tick next to <span class="csg-menu-option">Short menus</span> has disappeared.
        This shows that you no longer have short menus switched on.
        Instead, you have long menus switched on: most of the available PipeDream commands are shown on these.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move the pointer back into the PipeDream document window and click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> to bring up the PipeDream main menu.
        Bring up the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu.
        You will see that it is much longer than it was before.
    </p>
    <p>
        Short menus are much easier to use than long menus.
        They contain the commands which you need for all the operations you perform frequently.
        The extra commands on the long menus are either used very infrequently or, in the case of editing commands, are much more easily used from the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        For now, bring up the <span class="csg-menu">Icon</span> menu again, slide off the <span class="csg-menu-option">Choices</span> option
        and click the <span class="csg-menu-option">Short menus</span> command to switch on short menus again.
    </p>
    <p>
        After you have used PipeDream for a while, you may find that you want to add commands to or remove commands from the short menus.
        You can instruct PipeDream to do this and have your new choices used automatically each time you use PipeDream.
    </p>

    <h2>Classic Menus</h2>
    <p>If you are already comfortable with using key command sequences with PipeDream, you may wish to continue to use 'Classic' menus.</p>
    <p>
        If you bring up the <span class="csg-menu">Icon</span> menu and slide off the <span class="csg-menu-option">Choices</span> option,
        you will see that the <span class="csg-menu-option">Classic menus</span> command does not have a tick next to it.
        This shows that Classic menus are switched off.
        Move the pointer onto the <span class="csg-menu-option">Classic menus</span> option and click.
        Note that the menu will disappear even if you click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> as you have asked for the menus to be modified.
    </p>
    <p>This option will be saved if you give the <span class="csg-command">Save choices</span> command.</p>
