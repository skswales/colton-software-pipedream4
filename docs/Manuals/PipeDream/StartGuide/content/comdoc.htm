    <h1>Combined Documents</h1>
    <p>
        Because of its unique design, PipeDream enables you to combine word processing, database and spreadsheet work and charts within the same window.
        No cutting and pasting between different applications is necessary and operations such as searching and sorting can apply to all types of work.
    </p>
    <p>
        The best way to get an idea of what you can achieve by combining different sorts of work is to
        create a document consisting of different types of data yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this chapter, you are going to produce a report about a survey of penguins at four Antarctic research stations.
        The report will require word processing, spreadsheet work and the production of a chart to show the results of your survey.
        You will incorporate a picture into your document and into your chart and use different fonts to make the report as attractive as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        This chapter assumes that you have Trinity and Homerton fonts available.
        If you have just the System font you can still work through this chapter but the chart and the final report that you produce will not be as pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information and tutorial about creating charts in PipeDream,
        look in the <span class="csg-filename">Charts</span> directory in the PipeDream Examples.
    </p>
    <p>The final report that we are going to create is shown below:</p>
    <hr />
    <div><img src="images/pps_nl.png" alt="PPS Newsletter" /></div>
    <hr />
    <p>The document containing the start of the report may be found in the PipeDream Examples.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If you are using !Store as your app store, you will find that you already have the examples.</li>
        <li>If you are using !PackMan, select the PipeDream-Examples package for download.</li>
        <li>
            If you have downloaded the PipeDream Examples package from the web site,
            make a writable copy of the contents of the archive on your disc drive:
            open the PipeDream Examples package archive with SparkFS and drag its contents to a different location on your disc drive.
            Then close the PipeDream Examples package directory display to avoid confusion!

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            During February 1991, the PPS sent a team of researchers to Antarctica,
            using the money raised from the highly successful Christmas appeal. Their
            task was to highlight the need to preserve this last great wilderness as
            a home for penguins.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the final version, the heading is centred.</p>
    <p>Position the pointer at the beginning of cell A3 and drag down to A5 until the heading is marked.</p>
    <p>Give the <span class="csg-command">Centre Align</span> command:</p>

    <p>Click the mark block box to clear the marked block.</p>
    <p>When you move off the heading, you will see that it is centred.</p>

    <h2>Fonts</h2>
    <p>
        The final version of the document is displayed in different fonts from the one you have seen on the screen and on your print-outs so far.
        You can set a font for the whole document and also change the font for individual parts of it, such as headings.
        The document will be displayed on the screen and printed out in the font you have chosen.
    </p>
    <p>To set a font for the whole document:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Font</span> toolbar button <img src="images/toolbar/selfnt.png" alt="Font selector icon" />.</li>
        <li>The <span class="csg-dbox">Font Selector</span> dialogue box will appear.</li>
        <li>In the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Font</span> list box, click <span class="csg-dbox-option-value">Trinity</span>.</li>

        <li>Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button">Set</span></span> button.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The document will be displayed in 15 point Trinity.Medium.</p>
    <p>Because you have changed the font, you need to reformat the text:</p>
    <p>Position the caret in cell A8.</p>
    <p>Give the Format Paragraph command:</p>
    <table class="csg-command-table">

    </table>
    <p>To specify a change of font for the heading:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Position the caret at the beginning of cell A3, before the word <span style="font-size: 15pt; font-family: serif;">PENGUIN</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When you move to the line containing the heading, the text will jump to the left to make it easier to edit.</p>
    <!-- ol start="2" -->
    <ul class="csg-netsurf-2434">
        <li>2. Click Adjust on the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Font</span> toolbar button.</li>
        <li>3. The <span class="csg-dbox">Local Font</span> dialogue box will appear.</li>
        <li>4. In the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Font</span> list box, click <span class="csg-dbox-option-value">Homerton</span>.</li>
        <li>5. In the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Weight</span> list box, click <span class="csg-dbox-option-value">Bold</span>.</li>
        <li>6. In the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Point Size</span> group, click the <span class="csg-dbox-button">18</span> button.</li>
        <li>7. Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button">Set</span></span> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        PipeDream will insert a text @-field in front of the word
        <span style="font-size: 15pt; font-family: serif;">PENGUIN</span> which reads <code>@F:Homerton.Bold,18@</code>.
        This changes the font for the text in this cell only.
        When you move off the cell, the text @-field is not displayed.
        Instead, the heading text is displayed in 18 point Homerton.Bold:
    </p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">PENGUIN PRESERVATION SOCIETY</span></p>
    <!-- ol start="8" -->
    <ul class="csg-netsurf-2434">
        <li>8. Repeat the process for cell A5.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The whole heading will be displayed in 18 point Homerton.Bold.</p>

    <h2>Changing column widths</h2>
    <p>
        If you look at the final version, you will see that the second paragraph is indented.
        Change the width of column A so that it gives an indent for the second paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move the pointer to the right hand border of column A.
        The shape of the pointer will change.
        Drag to the left until the number in the mark block box changes to 7.
        If you drag too far to the left, you can drag back to the right.
        When you drag column borders in this way, the mark block box displays the current width of the column.
    </p>
    <p>Column A now has a width of 7.</p>
    <p>Now you can start to type in the rest of the document.</p>
    <p>Position the caret in cell A13 and then press <span class="csg-key">Tab</span>.</p>
    <p>Type the second paragraph:</p>
    <div class="csg-sample-indent csg-sample" style="width: 45%; font-family: serif;">
        <p>
            To confirm the extremely large number of penguins depending
            on Antarctica as a base, the team kept a record of the number
            of penguins sighted on our four research bases during
            February.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>As you get to the end of the first line, the text will wrap onto the next line and start from column B.</p>

    <h2>Building the Spreadsheet</h2>
    <p>
        The next thing to do is to create a spreadsheet for the data collected by the research team.
        This will form the basis for your chart.
    </p>
    <p>
        With PipeDream, there is no need to switch into a different mode or load a different program
        just because you have been typing text and are now about to create a spreadsheet.
        Both types of work are carried out in the same window.
    </p>
    <p>Position the caret in cell B18 and type <span class="csg-user-text">Base</span>.</p>
    <p>Now press <span class="csg-command">Tab</span> to position the caret in cell C18 and type <span class="csg-user-text">Total No</span>.</p>
    <p>
        Type <span class="csg-user-text">Week 1</span> into cell D18,
        <span class="csg-user-text">Week 2</span> into cell E18,
        <span class="csg-user-text">Week 3</span> into cell F18 and
        <span class="csg-user-text">Week 4</span> into cell G18.
    </p>
    <p>Position the caret in cell B20 and type the name of the first research station, <span class="csg-user-text">Palmer</span>.</p>
    <p>Continue down the column entering the names of the other research stations.</p>
    <p>
        As you will be entering mainly number cell items from now on, it is a good idea to tell PipeDream to make all new cells number cells.
        Also, as you are going to show numbers of penguins in this spreadsheet rather than prices, it is best to display the numbers with no decimal places:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Give the <span class="csg-command">Options</span> command.</li>
        <li>
            Set the <span class="csg-dbox-option">New cell format</span> option to <span class="csg-dbox-option-value">Numbers</span>.
            This tells PipeDream that when you start typing into a new cell, it should attempt to interpret your entry as a number or a formula.
        </li>
        <li>Use the up / down arrow buttons to change the setting for decimal places to zero.</li>
        <li>Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button">Set</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now you can type in the numbers as shown in the table.</p>
    <p>As you can see, you need to make column B wider to accommodate the names of the bases.</p>
    <p>
        Move the pointer to the right hand border of column B.
        The shape of the pointer will change.
        Drag to the right until the column width displayed in the mark block box changes to 17.
        If you drag too far to the right, you can drag back to the left.
        When you drag column borders in this way, the mark block box displays the width of the column.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, position the caret in cell C20.
        Click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Function</span> toolbar button.
        This is the curly <em>f<sub>x</sub></em> button to the left of the formula line.
        Slide off the <span class="csg-menu-option">Maths</span> option on the menu displayed.
        You will see a list of mathematical functions.
        Click <span class="csg-menu-option">SUM</span>.
        Click in cell D20.
        Click in cell G20.
        The formula line should read <code>SUM(D20G20)</code>.
        Click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Tick</span> toolbar button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).
    </p>
    <p>Drag until cells C20 to C23 are marked.</p>
    <p>Give the <span class="csg-command">Replicate Down</span> command from the <span class="csg-menu">Blocks</span> menu.</p>
    <p>Click the mark block box to clear the marked block.</p>
    <p>The data in your spreadsheet is now complete.</p>
    <p>Mark the whole document by clicking the mark block box.</p>
    <p>
        Then give the <span class="csg-command">Auto Width</span> command.
        This ensures that each column is the best width for the data it contains.
    </p>
    <p>Clear the marked block by clicking the mark block box.</p>
    <p>The headings Total No., Week 1, Week 2, Week 3 and Week 4 need to be right aligned so that they line up with the figures beneath them.</p>
    <p>Mark the headings and give the <span class="csg-command">Right Align</span> command.</p>
    <p>After entering so much data, it is wise to save your document.</p>
    <p>Also, you are about to produce a chart from a spreadsheet; you can only do this if the document containing the spreadsheet has been saved.</p>
    <p>Give the <span class="csg-command">Save</span> command (<span class="csg-key">F3</span> or <span class="csg-cmdseq">Cmd-FS</span>).</p>
    <p>
        When the <span class="csg-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box appears,
        click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button">Save</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).
    </p>

    <h2>Producing the Chart</h2>
    <p>
        Very often, numeric information is more easily understood when presented in chart form.
        Now is the time to make a Penguin Graph!
    </p>
    <p>The first thing to do is to mark the block of information you want to be included in the chart.</p>
    <p>Be careful not to include headings which you do not want to have in the final chart.</p>
    <p>Give the <span class="csg-command">New Chart</span> command:</p>
    <table class="csg-command-table">
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Chart</td>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        You will see the Chart Editing Window containing your chart.
        It will appear as a three-dimensional bar chart.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the adjust size icon of the Chart Editing Window to resize the chart until its appearance is pleasing.
        Notice that as you resize the chart editing window, the chart is redrawn and reformatted appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>You can alter the chart&rsquo;s appearance by selecting any of its parts and applying settings to them.</p>
    <p>
        First, select the <em>y</em>-axis by clicking on it.
        This is the vertical line at the left-hand side of the chart on which the numbers are displayed.
        When you have selected the axis, it will be outlined by a red dotted line and
        Axis 2 will appear in the top left hand corner of the Chart Editing Window.
    </p>
    <p>With the pointer in the Chart Editing Window, press Menu.</p>
    <p>
        You will see the <span class="csg-menu">Chart Editing</span> Menu.
        Slide off the <span class="csg-menu-option">Selection</span> option and
        choose the <span class="csg-menu-option">Axis</span> option.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will see the <span class="csg-dbox">Axis</span> dialogue box.
        If the numbers up the vertical axis do not increase in steps of 1000,
        change the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Major tick interval</span> setting to 1000.
        Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span></span> button.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the Chart Editing Window, press Menu.
        Slide off the <span class="csg-menu-option">Gallery</span> option and
        choose the <span class="csg-menu-option">Bar...</span> option
        to bring up the <span class="csg-dbox">Bar Gallery</span>.
        In the <span class="csg-dbox">Bar Gallery</span>
        click the <span class="csg-dbox-option">3-D on</span> option to switch off 3-D.
        3-D can be good for business charts but less so for penguins!
        Click the button showing a set of stacked penguins and then
        click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span></span> button.
    </p>
    <p>Now that your chart is ready, you need to save it into your document.</p>
    <p>In the document&rsquo;s window, position the caret in cell B25.</p>
    <p>Slide off the <span class="csg-menu-option">Save</span> option in the <span class="csg-menu">Chart Editing</span> Menu.</p>
    <p>Slide off the <span class="csg-menu-option">Chart</span> option.</p>
    <p>
        Drag the chart&rsquo;s file icon into the document window.
        The chart&rsquo;s file icon looks like a PipeDream icon.
    </p>
    <p>
        The chart is positioned in your document at the caret position.
        You may need to press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span> a few times to scroll the chart into the window.
    </p>
    <p>If the chart does not look right, move back into cell B25 where you will see something like <code>@G:Pengui_C01,100@</code>.</p>
    <p>
        100 is a percentage scale factor, which instructs PipeDream to draw the picture at 100% of its normal size.
        Changing the number rescales the chart.

    <h2>Making Changes to Your Data</h2>
    <p>
        You now have a document consisting of text, spreadsheet and chart.
        What is more, both the spreadsheet and the chart are dynamic.
        If you receive new information, you can make changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, you hear from one of your team of researchers that the figure given for
        penguins sighted at Dumont d&#39;Urville in the fourth week of February is wrong.
        In fact only 720 penguins were seen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make this change to your spreadsheet by typing 720 into cell G22.
        You will see the total number change accordingly.
        Also, your chart will change to reflect the new figure.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting a Font for the Chart</h2>
    <p>The text on the chart can be displayed in different fonts in the same way as the document text.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Give the <span class="csg-command">Edit Chart</span> command:</li>
    </ol>
    <table class="csg-command-table">

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>You will see a list of charts, probably only containing the name of the chart you have just produced, Chart&nbsp;1. Click Chart&nbsp;1.</p>
    <p>The chart will be displayed in the Chart Editing Window.</p>
    <!-- ol start="2" -->
    <ul class="csg-netsurf-2434">

    <p>When you are happy with the appearance of the chart, close the Chart Editing Window by clicking its close icon.</p>

    <h2>Adding a Picture to Your Document</h2>
    <p>One final change is to add the Penguin Preservation Society&rsquo;s logo as a document heading.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If necessary, resize the PipeDream document window so that you can see the icon bar.</li>
        <li>Position the caret at the beginning of cell A1.</li>
        <li>Bring up the PipeDream Examples directory display.</li>
        <li>Double-click Select on the Tutorial directory to open it.</li>
        <li>Drag the icon called Logo into the window of your document.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Pictures of penguins will appear on each side of the title.</p>
    <p>At this stage, it is advisable to save your document again.</p>

    <h2>Printing the Document</h2>
    <p>
        If your document contains fonts, charts, the grid or pictures, you need to use a RISC OS printer driver to print it.
        Your Penguins document contains fonts, a chart and a picture!
        Ensure that a RISC OS printer driver is loaded - the desired printer driver icon should be present on the icon bar.
        If you do not know how to load a RISC OS printer driver, consult your RISC OS <em>User Guide</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Give the <span class="csg-command">Print</span> command.</p>
    <table class="csg-command-table">
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <tbody>

                <th class="csg-ct-th-cmdseq">Cmd-sequence</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td><span class="csg-key">Print</span></td>
                <td><span class="csg-cmdseq">PO</span></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>You will see the <span class="csg-dbox">Print</span> dialogue box.</p>
    <p>
        At the top of the dialogue box, you will see the type of RISC OS printer driver currently available.
        Make sure that this is what you want.
    </p>
    <p>At this stage, you should not need to change any of the other settings.</p>
    <p>Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button">Print</span></span> button.</p>
    <p>Assuming your printer is correctly connected to your computer and is on-line, your document will be printed.</p>
