    <h1>Conventions</h1>
    <p>Before you start to use PipeDream 4, you should be familiar with the RISC OS desktop.</p>
    <p>You should know how to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>use the icons on the icon bar to run applications and open documents;</li>
        <li>use the mouse and pointer to position the caret and understand terms and techniques such as click, double-click and drag;</li>
        <li>scroll a window using the scroll bars;</li>
        <li>change the size and position of windows using the back icon, the toggle size icon, the adjust size icon and the title bar;</li>
        <li>close windows using the close icon;</li>
        <li>bring up menus and choose commands.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should also understand terms such as dialogue box, directory and directory display.</p>
    <p>If you are not familiar with any of the terms or techniques above, please refer to your RISC OS <em>User Guide</em>.</p>

    <h2>Using the Mouse</h2>
    <p>The three mouse buttons are referred to as follows:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>Select — Left mouse button;</li>
        <li>Menu — Middle mouse button;</li>
        <li>Adjust — Right mouse button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Pressing and releasing a mouse button is described as <strong>clicking</strong>.
        Mouse buttons are usually referred to by name.
        For example, click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> means that you should press and release the <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> button.
        Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> means that you should press and release the <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> button.
        Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> means that you should press and release the <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> button.
        Click without any button name is shorthand for click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> as this is the most common usage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pressing and releasing a mouse button twice in quick succession is described as <strong>double-clicking</strong>.
        Again, the mouse button is usually specified.
        For example, double-click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> means that you should press and release <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> twice in quick succession without moving the mouse.
        Double-click without any button name is shorthand for double-click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pressing and holding down a mouse button while you move the mouse is described as <strong>dragging</strong>.
        Once again, the mouse button is usually specified.
        Drag <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> means that you should press and hold down <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> while moving the mouse.
    </p>

    <h2>The Pointer and the Caret</h2>
    <p>It is very important that you understand clearly the distinction between these two items:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
            Pointer — An arrow-shaped icon that moves as you move the mouse.
        </li>
        <li>
            Caret — A red <span class="csg-greek-symbol">I</span>-shaped icon (<img src="images/caret.png" alt="caret" style="vertical-align: bottom;">)
            that shows where the next character you type will appear.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Generally, the pointer has no effect until you click a mouse button.
        To position the caret, you use the mouse to move the pointer to the required position and click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>Keys</h2>
    <p>When you are asked to press a single key on the keyboard, it will be expressed as follows:</p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent">Press <span class="csg-key">A</span>.</p>
    <p>This means that you should press and release the key which has the letter ‘A’ on it.</p>
    <p>
        Some keys can appear to be ambiguous.
        For example:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
            <code>O</code> is the letter ‘oh’,
            whereas <code>0</code> is the figure zero.
            On some keyboards, zero may be shown as 0 with a slash through it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>l</code> is the lower-case letter ‘el’,
            whereas <code>1</code> is the figure one.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>x</code> is the lower-case letter ‘ex’,
            whereas <code>*</code> is what you use to express multiplication.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>|</code> is used to represent the character which appears as a
            solid vertical bar on the screen and on the keyboard
            (it may appear as a broken vertical bar on some PC-style keyboards).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you are asked to press one of the keys on the keyboard which has a word written on it, this will be expressed as follows:</p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent">Press <span class="csg-key">Delete</span>.</p>
    <p>This means that you should press and release the key which has ‘Delete’ written on it.</p>
    <p>Note the following:</p>
    <p>
        <span class="csg-key-arrow">&larr; &uarr; &rarr; &darr;</span>
        are the arrow keys which you can use to move the caret about the document as an alternative to using the mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="csg-key">&crarr;</span> refers to the key on the right-hand
        side of the main keyboard which is usually used to complete an operation.
        You may know this key as <span class="csg-key">Return</span> —
        it is written as <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span> in the rest of the PipeDream documentation.
        Note that this key may have ‘Enter’ printed on it on some keyboards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pressing the <span class="csg-key">Backspace &#x21a4;</span> key
        deletes anything to the left of the caret.
        You can also use the <span class="csg-key">Delete</span> key.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-key">Escape</span> key can usually be used to abandon an operation.
        It is sometimes known as the ‘Esc’ key.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the <span class="csg-key">End</span> key may also have ‘Copy’ printed on it on older Archimedes-style keyboards.
        In PipeDream, this key is generally used to move to the bottom of a column.
    </p>
    <p><span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> and <span class="csg-key">Shift</span> are held down simultaneously with other keys to modify their effect.</p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <p>Press <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-T</span> means:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Press and hold down the <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> key.</li>
        <li>Press and release the <span class="csg-key">T</span> key.</li>
        <li>Release the <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> key.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that the <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> key is also represented by <span class="csg-key">^</span> and is shown as such on menu short cuts.</p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <p>Press <span class="csg-key">^X</span> means:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Press and hold down the <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> key.</li>
        <li>Press and release the <span class="csg-key">X</span> key.</li>
        <li>Release the <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> key.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Similarly, the <span class="csg-key">Shift</span> key is also represented by a broad up-arrow.</p>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-key">Alt</span> key is found on the left-hand and right-hand sides of the keyboard,
        and may be used to generate characters which do not appear on the keyboard, such as é.
    </p>
    <p>Words that you type are usually shown in a computer typeface.</p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <p>
        Type  <span class="csg-user-text">lesson</span> <span class="csg-key">&crarr;</span> 
        means that you should type the word ‘lesson’ and then press the <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span> key.
    </p>
    <p>Longer sections to be typed  <span class="csg-sample">may be given in this typeface</span>  so that the text does not appear too ugly.</p>
    <p>Words shown in italics are not to be typed in literally, but indicate that you should substitute what the word represents.</p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <p><span class="csg-sample-indent csg-filename">  <em>filename</em></span></p>
    <p>would represent the name of your file.</p>
