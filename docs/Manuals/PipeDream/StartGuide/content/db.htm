    <h1>Databases</h1>
    <p>
        PipeDream enables you to store a database of records and provides facilities to sort your records on one or more fields.
        You can save and print out those records which satisfy one or more conditions which you specify.
        PipeDream also provides several database functions which enable you to produce statistics about your records.
    </p>
    <p>
        The best way to become familiar with using PipeDream as a database is to load a database of records and try out the various facilities upon it.
        An example is a pupil records database called <span class="csg-filename">Markbook</span>,
        which is provided in the PipeDream Examples, in the <span class="csg-filename">Tutorial</span> directory.
    </p>

    <h2>Loading the Example (Markbook) Database</h2>
    <p>To load the example database:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If you are using PlingStore as your app store, you will find that you already have the examples.</li>
        <li>If you are using PackMan as your package manager, select the <var>PipeDream-Examples</var> package for download.</li>
        <li>
            If you have downloaded the PipeDream Examples package from the web site,
            make a writable copy of the contents of the archive on your disc drive:
            open the PipeDream Examples package archive with SparkFS and drag its contents to a different location on your disc drive.
            Then close the PipeDream Examples package directory display to avoid confusion!
        </li>
        <li>Double-click the <span class="csg-filename">Tutorial</span> directory&rsquo;s icon to open a directory display.</li>
        <li>Double-click the <span class="csg-filename">Markbook</span> file&rsquo;s icon to load it into PipeDream.</li>
        <li>When the file has been loaded into PipeDream, use the toggle size icon if you need to change the size of the document window.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The database consists of a list of pupils together with their
        classes, subjects (one of history or physics, indicated by H or P),
        continuous assessment marks, examination marks and total marks.
        Each record is stored on one row and each field is in a separate column.
    </p>
    <p>If you scroll down through the database, you will find that the column headings, which let you know which field is in each column, disappear from the top of the window.</p>

    <h2>Fixing Rows</h2>
    <p>It is possible to fix rows so that the column headings always remain at the top of the window. To do so:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Position the caret on row two.</li>
        <li>Give the <span class="csg-command">Fix Row</span> command:</li>
    </ol>
    <table class="csg-command-table">
        <col>
        <col>
        <col>
        <col>
        <col>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-menu">Menu</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-command">Command</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-tool-none">Tool</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-key-none">Key</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-cmdseq">Cmd-sequence</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Layout</td>
                <td>Fix row</td>
                <td></td>
                <td></td>
                <td><span class="csg-cmdseq">LAF</span></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The borders of rows one and two change colour to show that the rows are fixed.</p>
    <p>
        Try scrolling down through the database.
        You will see that rows one and two remain at the top of the window.
    </p>

    <h2>Sorting the Database</h2>
    <p>
        When you first load the database it is sorted on column C, i.e. on class.
        You will see that all the pupils in 1A are first, followed by those in 1B, then 2A, then 2B.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would rather have the pupils listed in alphabetical order of surname,
        you need to sort the database on column B, the column containing the surnames.
    </p>
    <p>To sort on column B:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mark the block of records you want to sort by dragging down the borders of rows 3 to 39.
            Dragging down the row border marks all of the columns in these rows.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that dragging beyond the bottom of the window has the effect of scrolling downwards so that you can see and mark data which was not visible at first.</p>

        <li>
            3. When the <span class="csg-dbox">Sort</span> dialogue box appears,
            delete <span class="csg-dbox-option-value">A</span> with the
            <span class="csg-key">Backspace</span> key and type
            <span class="csg-user-text">B</span> since this is the column you want to sort on.
        </li>
        <li>4. Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Sort</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).</li>
        <li>
            5. Click the mark block box to clear the marked block.
            The records will be sorted in alphabetical order of surname.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>PipeDream also enables you to sort on more than one column at once.</p>
    <p>
        If you want to list pupils in classes 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B in order of the total marks they gained in history and physics,
        you need to sort first on column C, which contains the classes,
        then on column D, which contains the the subjects,
        and finally on column G, the one containing the total marks.
    </p>
    <p>Mark rows 3 to 39 by dragging down the row borders.</p>
    <p>Give the <span class="csg-command">Sort</span> command.</p>
    <p>
        Type <span class="csg-key">C</span> on the first row of the dialogue box,
        <span class="csg-key">D</span> on the second row and
        <span class="csg-key">G</span> on the third row.
        To move through the dialogue box, press <span class="csg-key-arrow">&darr;</span> or or click in the field you want.
    </p>
    <p>Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Sort</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).</p>
    <p>
        The records are now arranged in order of class, then subject, then total mark,
        enabling you to see who was first in history in class 1A,
        who was bottom in physics in class 2A, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>Clear the marked block by clicking the mark block box.</p>

    <h2>Searching for Records</h2>
    <p>If you want to find a particular pupil&rsquo;s record quickly, you can use Search to find him or her.</p>
    <p>Give the <span class="csg-command">Search</span> command:</p>
    <table class="csg-command-table">

    <p>Searching can be especially helpful if you have a very large database.</p>

    <h2>Selecting Records</h2>
    <p>One of the most useful aspects of database use is the ability to save and print records which satisfy certain conditions.</p>
    <p>If you need to predict your pupils&rsquo; GCSE results, for example, you might want to know which pupils in class 1A who study history got a total mark higher than 100.</p>
    <p>Or you might want to know which pupils got either a continuous assessment mark lower than 50 or an examination mark lower than 45 so that you can give them extra attention next term.</p>
    <p>To find out which pupils in class 1A who study history got a total mark higher than 100:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If necessary, shrink the document window a little so that you can see the PipeDream icon on the icon bar.</li>
        <li>Give the <span class="csg-command">Save</span> command.</li>
        <li>When the <span class="csg-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box appears, click the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Save selection of rows</span> check box.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> to position the caret in the input field to the right of the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Save selection of rows</span> check box.</li>
        <li>Type the following:</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent csg-user-text">C1C39=&quot;1A&quot; &amp; D1D39=&quot;H&quot; &amp; G1G39&gt;100</p>
    <p>The condition is too long to be completely visible in the dialogue box input field, so the field will scroll as you type.</p>
    <p> It tells PipeDream to save all those rows which have 1A in column C, H in column D and a number higher than 100 in column G.</p>
    <p>
        The cell references you have typed, C1, D1 and G1,
        will be updated automatically for each new line in the database,
        changing to C2, D2 and G2,
        then C3, D3 and G3, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>Notice that any text included in your condition must be enclosed within double quotation marks, for example "1A".</p>
    <p>The &amp; sign is used to link conditions when there are more than one.</p>
    <p>The conditions on both sides of the &amp; sign must be true for the record to be selected.</p>
    <!-- ol start="6" -->
    <ul class="csg-netsurf-2434">
        <li>6. Drag the PipeDream file icon from the <span class="csg-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box onto the PipeDream icon on the icon bar.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A new PipeDream document window will appear on the screen containing the records you selected,
        i.e. a list of all pupils in class 1A who study history and got a total mark higher than 100.
    </p>
    <p>You can now save the new file or print it out, depending upon your requirements.</p>
    <p>To find out which pupils got a continuous assessment mark lower than 50 or an examination mark lower than 45:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>With the pointer in the example database window, give the <span class="csg-command">Save</span> command.</li>
        <li>When the <span class="csg-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box appears, select the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Save selection of rows</span> check box.</li>
        <li>Delete any contents from the input field using the <span class="csg-dbox">Backspace</span> key and type the following:</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent csg-user-text"><code>E1E39&lt;50 | F1F39&lt;45</code></p>
    <p>
        To type <span class="csg-user-text">|</span>, hold down
        <span class="csg-key">Shift</span> and press the
        <span class="csg-key">\</span> (backslash) key,
        which is usually either just above the <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>
        key or to the left of the <span class="csg-key">Z</span> key on
        UK PC-style keyboards.
    </p>
    <p>This tells PipeDream to save all those rows which have either a number lower than 50 in column E or a number lower than 45 in column F.</p>
    <p>
        | is used to represent &lsquo;OR&rsquo;.
        Only one of the conditions needs to be true for the record to be selected.
    </p>
    <!-- ol start="4" -->
    <ul class="csg-netsurf-2434">
        <li>4. Drag the PipeDream file icon from the <span class="csg-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box onto the PipeDream icon on the icon bar.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A new PipeDream document window will appear on the screen containing the records you selected,
        i.e. a list of all pupils who either got an assessment mark lower than 50 or an exam mark lower than 45.
    </p>
    <p>Once again, you can save the new file or print it out, depending upon your requirements.</p>

    <h2>Entering Records</h2>
    <p>
        You can type new records into PipeDream in the same way as you type text.
        Type each record on a separate row and each field of the record into a separate column.
    </p>
    <p>
        Try entering a few new records into the Markbook database.
        Position the caret in cell A15, for example.
    </p>
    <p>Give the <span class="csg-command">Insert Row</span> command:</p>
    <table class="csg-command-table">
        <col>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        Type in the first name of a pupil.
        Press <span class="csg-key">Tab</span>.
        You are now in column B, ready to type in the pupil&rsquo;s surname.
        When you have done so, press <span class="csg-key">Tab</span> again to move to column C, where you can type in the pupil&rsquo;s class.
        Continue in this way until the pupil&rsquo;s record is complete.
    </p>
    <p>Try adding more pupil records to the database.</p>

    <h2>Deleting Records</h2>
    <p>If a pupil leaves the school, you will want to remove his or her record from the database.</p>
    <p>
        Position the caret on the row you want to delete.
        Give the <span class="csg-command">Delete Row</span> command:

    <h2>Database Functions</h2>
    <p>
        PipeDream provides a number of database functions which enable you to produce statistics about selected records in your database.
        The records are selected by the condition which forms the second part of the database function.
    </p>
    <p>For example, you can use the function DCOUNTA to find out how many of your pupils study history:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Position the caret in an unused cell such as A40.</li>
        <li>Click in the formula line.</li>
        <li>Type the following:</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent csg-user-text"><code>DCOUNTA(D3D39, D3D39=&quot;H&quot;)</code></p>
    <!-- ol start="4" -->
    <ul class="csg-netsurf-2434">
        <li>4. Click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Tick</span> toolbar button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The number of pupils who study history appears in the cell containing the DCOUNTA formula.</p>
    <p>D3D39 is the range of cells upon which you want to carry out the function i.e. all cells from D3 to D39 inclusive.</p>
    <p>D3D39=&quot;H&quot; is the condition. You only want to count the cells in the range D3D39 which contain H.</p>
    <p>Note that the parameters of the function are enclosed within brackets and any text, in this case H, within double quotation marks.</p>
    <p>If you want to know the average physics exam result:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Position the caret in a blank cell such as F41.</li>
        <li>Click in the formula line.</li>
        <li>Type the following:</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent csg-user-text"><code>DAVG(F3F39, D3D39=&quot;P&quot;)</code></p>
    <!-- ol start="4" -->
    <ul class="csg-netsurf-2434">
        <li>4. Click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Tick</span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The average physics result appears in the cell.</p>
    <p>
        There are many other database functions which are explained fully in the
        <a href="../../RefGuide/content/functions/database.html">Database Functions</a> section of the <a href="../../RefGuide/index.html">Reference Guide</a>.
