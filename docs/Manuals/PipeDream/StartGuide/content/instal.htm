    <h1>Installation</h1>
    <p>Installing PipeDream on your computer is now very simple. Choose the most appropriate method:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you are using !Store as your app store, select the PipeDream package from the catalogue;</li>
        <li>If you are using !PackMan as your package manager, select the PipeDream package for download;</li>
        <li>
            Download the latest version of PipeDream from the <a href="http://croftnuisk.co.uk/coltsoft/pipedream">web site</a>.
            You will find that it is supplied as a RiscPkg format archive file.
            Double-click on the PipeDream package file to open it with !SparkFS.
            The !PipeDream application may be found in the <span class="csg-filename">Apps</span> directory in that archive.
            Copy this to the desired location on your disc or network server.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>You will probably find it helpful to obtain a copy of the PipeDream Examples package at this point to use with the <em>Getting Started Guide</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you are using !Store as your app store, you will find that you already have the examples;</li>
        <li>If you are using !PackMan as your package manager, select the PipeDream-Examples package for download;</li>
        <li>Download the PipeDream Examples package from the web site and, as above, extract its contents to wherever you wish.</li>
    </ul>
