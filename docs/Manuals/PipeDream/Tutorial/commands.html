<h1>Commands</h1>

<p>PipeDream can perform a number of operations called commands. Commands
enable you to move around within your PipeDream windows and edit your data.
They can be given by means of menus or directly from the keyboard.</p>

<h2>Menus</h2>

<p>Bring up the PipeDream main menu by clicking Menu (the centre mouse button).
The pointer must be within the PipeDream window when you do this.</p>

<p>The PipeDream main menu is a list of the menus available in PipeDream.</p>

<p>As you will see, each of the items on the PipeDream main menu has an arrow
to the right. This means that each item has its own menu.</p>

<p>To choose the <span class="csguide-menu">Edit</span> menu, for example,
move the pointer onto the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Edit</span> option,
then slide it over the arrow on the right.
The <span class="csguide-menu">Edit</span> menu will appear.</p>

<p>The <span class="csguide-menu">Edit</span> menu, like the other PipeDream menus, is a list of commands.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use the <span class="csguide-menu">Edit</span> menu,
simply move the pointer back onto the main menu. The <span
class="csguide-menu">Edit</span> menu disappears and you can make another choice from
the main menu. If you want to get rid of the main menu, click Select anywhere
outside the menu or press <strong><code>Esc</code></strong>. The main menu will
disappear.</p>

<p>Click Menu again to bring up the PipeDream main menu. Move the pointer onto
the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Blocks</span> option and slide it over
the arrow on the right to bring up the <span class="csguide-menu">Blocks</span>
menu. You will see that many commands on the <span class="csguide-menu">Blocks</span> menu have an arrow
after their name. This means that you need to move the pointer over the arrow
to see something else before you can carry out the command. This will usually
be a dialogue box, although it may be a window providing information.</p>

<p>Move the pointer onto the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Search</span>
command, for example, then slide it over the arrow immediately to the right.
The <span class="csguide-dbox">Search</span> dialogue box will appear.</p>

<h2>Dialogue Boxes</h2>

<p>A dialogue box is a window used to specify information before carrying out a
command. Some dialogue boxes contain boxes where you type in information. In
the <span class="csguide-dbox">Search</span> dialogue box, for example, there is a box where you can type in the
word for which you want to search. For the moment, simply move the pointer back
onto the Blocks menu. The <span class="csguide-dbox">Search</span> dialogue box will disappear.</p>

<p>Some dialogue boxes list options from which you make a selection. Move the
pointer onto the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Save</span> command on the
<span class="csguide-menu">Files</span> menu, then move it over the arrow.
You will see the <span class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box.</p>

<p>Move the pointer onto the <span class="csguide-option">Save only marked
block</span> option and click Select.</p>

<p>You will see an 'on' indicator appear in the box next to the option. This means
that the option has been turned on. Click Select on the option again to turn it
off.</p>

<p>Look at the bottom of the <span class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box.
Here, there are several <span class="csguide-option">Format</span>
options, each with a button next to it. These are called radio buttons. The
radio button next to PipeDream has a visible indicator within it to show that
the <span class="csguide-option">PipeDream</span> option is selected.</p>

<p>Move the pointer onto the <span class="csguide-option">ASCII</span> option
and click Select. The radio button next to the <span
class="csguide-option">ASCII option</span> will now have the
visible indicator within it and the radio button next to the <span
class="csguide-option">PipeDream</span> option will be empty. Now click Select on the <span
class="csguide-option">PipeDream</span> option again.</p>

<p>When the options have radio buttons before them, you can only choose one
option.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you are not free to choose what you type into a box. You are
given a limited range of possibilities. Move the pointer to the up-arrow icon
after the <span class="csguide-option">Line separator</span> option and click
Select. The item in the box on the right changes as you click. The same
happens, but in the opposite direction, if you click Select on the down-arrow
icon.</p>

<p>When you have completed your dialogue box entries, you click either Select
or Adjust on the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button. If you click Select on the
<span class="csguide-option">OK</span> button, the command is carried out and the
dialogue box disappears. If you click Adjust on the <span
class="csguide-option">OK</span> button, the command is carried out and the dialogue
box remains on the screen. Pressing <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> has the
same effect as clicking Select on the <span class="csguide-option">OK</span> button.</p>

<p>For the moment, don't click on <span class="csguide-option">OK</span> or
press <code><strong>Enter</strong></code>.</p>

<p>If you want to abandon a dialogue box, press the
<span class="csguide-key">Esc</span> key.</p>

<h2>Moving around the dialogue box</h2>

<p>To move from option to option either use the mouse or
<span class="csguide-key">Tab</span> or
<span class="csguide-key">Shift-Tab</span>.</p>

<p>Move the pointer back onto the <span class="csguide-menu">Files</span> menu.</p>

<p>You will see that some of the commands do not have arrows after their names.
This means that you can carry out the command directly from the menu, without
needing to make any further choices or supply any more information. To do so,
move the pointer onto the command and click Select.</p>

<p>The command will be carried out and the menu will disappear.</p>

<p>If you click Adjust on a command, the command will be carried out but the
menu will remain on the screen ready for you to select another command or
repeat the previous one.</p>

<h2>The Icon Menu</h2>

<p>The Icon menu is displayed by clicking Menu on the PipeDream icon on the
icon bar.</p>

<h2>Short Menus and Long Menus</h2>

<p>When you first start using PipeDream, the menus you see are short menus,
which display the most frequently used commands. If you bring up the <span
class="csguide-menu">Icon</span> menu
and slide off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Choices</span> option, you will
see that the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Short menus</span> command has a
tick next to it. This shows that short menus are switched on. Move the pointer
onto the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Short menus</span> option and click
Select. You will see that the tick next to <span class="csguide-menu-option">Short
menus</span> has disappeared. This shows that you no longer have short menus
switched on. Instead, you have long menus switched on. Long menus show all the
available commands.</p>

<p>Move the pointer back into the PipeDream window and press Menu to bring up
the PipeDream main menu. Bring up the <span class="csguide-menu">Edit</span> menu.
You will see that it is much longer than it was before.</p>

<p>Short menus are much easier to use than long menus. They contain the
commands which you need for all the operations you perform frequently. The
extra commands on the long menus are either used very infrequently or, in the
case of editing commands, are much more easily used from the keyboard.</p>

<p>After you have used PipeDream for a while, you may find that you want to add
commands to or remove commands from the short menus. You can instruct PipeDream
to do this and have your new choices used automatically each time you use
PipeDream.</p>

<p>For now, bring up the <span class="csguide-menu">Icon</span> menu again,
slide off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Choices</span> option and click
Select on the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Short menus</span> command to
switch on short menus again.</p>

<h2>Keys</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that all commands on the menus have one, two, three or
four letters after their names. These are the keys you can press if you prefer
to use the keyboard to give commands rather than selecting them from the
menus.</p>

<p>You use the key combinations shown on the menus together with the
<span class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span> key.</p>

<p>For example, to save a file, you have the choice of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>choosing the <span class="csguide-menu">Files</span> menu and selecting the <span
    class="csguide-menu-option">Save</span> command by moving the pointer onto it
    and then sliding it over the arrow to the right;</li>
  <li>pressing <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-FS</span> .</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the key combinations are made up of the menu's initial letter
followed by a letter or letters which represent the command's name.</p>

<p><span class="csguide-key">FS</span>, for example, stands for Files Save.</p>

<p>The most commonly used commands consist of only one letter, so that you only
have to press one key with <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span>.</p>

<h2>Function keys</h2>

<p>For convenience, some commands have been assigned to the function keys, so
that they can be given with a single key press.</p>

<p>The function keys assigned to commands are shown on menus after the
command's name.</p>

<p>As you can see, PipeDream provides several methods of giving commands. It is
entirely up to you which method you use. Some people use one method all the
time; others use a combination of all of them.</p>

<p>Throughout this Tutorial and the Reference Guide, the various methods will
generally be shown as follows and it is up to you which method you use:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Edit</td>
      <td>Delete row</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">Y</span></td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">F8</span></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In the above case, for example, you could do one of the following:</p>

<p><em>Either:</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>Click Menu to bring up the PipeDream main menu.</li>
  <li>Move the pointer onto the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Edit</span>
    option and then slide it over the arrow to display the <span
    class="csguide-menu">Edit</span> menu.</li>
  <li>Click Select on the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Delete row</span>
    command.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Or:</em></p>

<ul><li>Press <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-Y</span></li></ul>

<p><em>Or:</em></p>

<ul><li>Press <span class="csguide-key">F8</span>.</li></ul>
