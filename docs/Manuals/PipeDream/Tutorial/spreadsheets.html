<h1>Spreadsheets</h1>

<p>As you have seen, a PipeDream window is divided into cells formed
where columns and rows meet.</p>

<p>Much of the power of PipeDream lies in the fact that you can create
different types of cell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>text cells which contain words and sentences;</li>
  <li>number cells which contain numbers and formulae.</li>
</ul>

<p>Number cells can contain virtually any mathematical formula and can
include references to other cells.</p>

<p>The best way to learn about number cells and PipeDream's
spreadsheet facilities is to put them into practice by building a
spreadsheet yourself. The spreadsheet you are going to build is shown
here:</p>

<p>PipeDream has a template file which contains the settings best suited
to spreadsheet work. It tells PipeDream that all new cells are number
cells, unless they contain only text, and ensures that each column is
formatted separately. It also turns on the grid to make your
spreadsheet easier to read.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click Menu on the PipeDream icon on the icon bar.</li>
  <li>Click Select on the <span class="csguide-menu-option">New document</span> option.</li>
  <li>Click Select on the <span class="csguide-option">Numbers</span> option.</li>
</ol>

<p>A new PipeDream document window appears on the screen ready for you to enter your spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Click Select on the toggle size icon so that the PipeDream document window fills the screen.</p>

<p>As usual when you start a new PipeDream document window, the caret is in cell A1.</p>

<h2>Building the Spreadsheet</h2>

<p>First of all, you need to type in the names of the items whose prices
the spreadsheet will manipulate. Type the first name as follows:</p>

<p><span class="csguide-key">Item</span></p>

<p>You will see the word you have typed appear in the formula line at the top of the window.
This is where PipeDream displays the contents of number cells. The
Numbers template file has told PipeDream to expect numbers.</p>

<p>If you make any typing mistakes, you can carry out corrections on the
formula line. Position the caret in the formula line by moving the
pointer to it and clicking Select. You can use the following keys in the
formula line:</p>

<table border="0">
  <col />
  <col />
  <tr>
    <td class="csguide-key">&larr;</td>
    <td>to move the caret one character to the left</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="csguide-key">&rarr;</td>
    <td>to move the caret one character to the right</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="csguide-key">Shift-&larr;</td>
    <td>to move the caret left one word</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="csguide-key">Shift-&rarr;</td>
    <td>to move the caret right one word</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="csguide-key">Ctrl-&larr;</td>
    <td>to move the caret to the beginning of the line</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="csguide-key">Ctrl-&rarr;</td>
    <td>to move the caret to the end of the line</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="csguide-key">Delete<br/>Backspace</td>
    <td>to delete the character to the left of the caret</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="csguide-key">Copy</td>
    <td>to delete the character to the right of the caret</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="csguide-key">Ctrl-Copy</td>
    <td>to delete forward to the end of the line</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="csguide-key">Ctrl-U</td>
    <td>to delete everything on the line</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>When you are happy with your entry in the formula line and you are ready to
enter it in the cell, press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<p>The word that you typed appears in your document in a text cell.
PipeDream wasn't able to make sense of it as a formula so it put the word into a text cell.
Type in the names of the remaining items in column A, remembering to move on to
the next line after each entry.</p>

<p>Position the caret in cell A1 by moving the pointer to it and pressing
Select.</p>

<p>Press <span class="csguide-key">Tab</span> to move the caret into cell B1. You will see that column B's
border is now displayed in a different colour.</p>

<p>Type the word <span class="csguide-key">Value</span> and press <span class="csguide-key">Tab</span>.
The caret is now in cell C1.
Column C's border is displayed in a different colour.</p>

<p>Type <span class="csguide-key">VAT</span> and press <span class="csguide-key">Tab</span> to position the caret in cell D1.</p>

<p>Type the word <span class="csguide-key">Total</span>.</p>

<p>Position the caret in cell B3. You can do this either by moving the
pointer to it and clicking <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span>-Select or by clicking Select and then
pressing <span class="csguide-key">Tab</span>.</p>

<p>Type <span class="csguide-key">500</span>.</p>

<p>The contents of cell B3 are displayed in the formula line.</p>

<p>Press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>. Cell B3 is a number cell containing the number 500.00.
Numbers in PipeDream are automatically displayed with two decimal
places although you can change this if you want to.</p>

<p>Press <span class="csguide-key">Tab</span> to position the caret in cell C3.</p>

<p>Type <span class="csguide-key">B3 * 0.175</span>. This formula multiplies the contents of cell B3 by 0.175
to work out the VAT.</p>

<p>Click Select on the tick box to the left of the formula line. This has the
same effect as pressing <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>. Cell C3 now displays the result of the
formula, i.e. 87.50. The formula line displays the formula itself so that
you can edit it if necessary.</p>

<p>Press <span class="csguide-key">Tab</span> to position the caret in cell D3.</p>

<p>Move the pointer to the formula line and click Select to position the
caret there. Now move the pointer to cell B3 and click Select. B3
appears in the formula line. Type <span class="csguide-key">+</span>. Now move the pointer to cell C3
and click Select. C3 appears in the formula line, so that the formula
line now reads B3+C3. Click on the tick box or press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>. The total price
appears in cell D3, 587.50.</p>

<h2>Alignment</h2>

<p>You may have noticed whilst typing the above that the words Value, VAT and Total are not
aligned with the numbers beneath them. This is because text cells are
automatically left-aligned whilst number cells are automatically right-aligned.
However, it will look better if the headings are right-aligned
so that they line up with the numbers. The simplest way to right align
cells B1, C1 and D1 is:</p>

<p>Mark the cells by dragging Select across them.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Right Align</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Layout</td>
      <td>Right align</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">LAR</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The column headings will now line up with the numbers beneath
them.</p>

<p>If you make a mistake at any point and end up with something you do
not want in the formula line, press <span class="csguide-key">Esc</span> or click <span
class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span>-Select on the cross icon
to the left of the formula line.</p>

<p>Position the caret in cell B4 by moving the pointer to it and clicking <span
class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span>-Select, then type <span class="csguide-key">200</span>.</p>

<p>Press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> twice and type <span class="csguide-key">250</span>.
Continue to type the rest of the values down to cell B7.</p>

<p>The next thing to do is to work out the VAT of the other prices in
addition to that of the computer.</p>

<p>Position the caret in cell C3 by moving the pointer to it and clicking
Select.</p>

<p>Now drag Select to cell C7 so that cells C3 to C7 inclusive are marked
as a block and displayed on a black background.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Replicate Down</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Blocks</td>
      <td>Replicate down</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">BRD</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>PipeDream replicates the formula you typed into cell C3 (B3 * 0.175)
to all the cells in the block, i.e. PipeDream copies the formula, updating
the cell reference in the formula as required. Cell C4, for example,
contains the formula B4 * 0.175.</p>

<p>Clear the marked block by clicking Select in the mark block box.</p>

<p>In the same way, the formula in cell D3 can be replicated into cells D4
to D7.</p>

<p>Mark the block from D3 to D7 inclusive.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Replicate Down</span> command.</p>

<p>Clear the marked block by clicking Select in the mark block box.</p>

<h2>Totals</h2>

<p>Position the caret in cell B9 by moving the caret to it and clicking <span
class="csguide-command">Ctrl</span>-Select.</p>

<p>Type SUM(B3B7) and either click Select on the tick box or press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.
The total value of all the items appears in cell B9.</p>

<p>SUM is a function which adds together the values of all cells in the
range you type in. It is the equivalent of typing B3+B4+B5+B6+B7 -
and much quicker!</p>

<p>Drag Select from cell B9 to cell D9 to mark cells B9, C9 and D9 as a
block.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Replicate Right</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Blocks</td>
      <td>Replicate right</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">BRR</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The formula in cell B9, SUM(B3B7), is replicated into cells C9 and D9
and updated accordingly. Cell C9 contains SUM(C3C7) and cell D9
contains SUM(D3D7).</p>

<p>Click Select in the mark block box to clear the marked block.</p>

<p>Position the caret in cell B11 by positioning the caret in it and clicking <span
class="csguide-command">Ctrl</span>-Select.</p>

<p>Type <span class="csguide-key">1200</span> and either click Select on the tick box or press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<p>Position the caret in cell B12 and type <span class="csguide-key">D9-B11</span>.</p>

<p>When you click Select on the tick box or press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>, PipeDream displays
the result of the formula which tells you the difference between the
total price for all the items and the sale price and so lets you know
how much money you are going to save.</p>

<h2>Recalculating Your Spreadsheet</h2>

<p>One reason why spreadsheets are so useful is that they are dynamic,
i.e. changing one entry changes all associated entries automatically.</p>

<p>Position the caret in cell B3, type <span class="csguide-key">600</span> and press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<p>Notice that all cells which refer to cell B3 change to suit the new
contents of cell B3.</p>

<p>Type <span class="csguide-key">500</span> and press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>
and the values in cells C3, D3, B9, C9, D9 and
B12 will all change again.</p>

<p>Try changing some values and see how your changes affect the spreadsheet.</p>

<h2>Leading Characters</h2>

<p>As the figures in this spreadsheet are all prices, it would be
appropriate for them all to have a &pound; sign in front of them.
Mark the document by clicking Select in the mark block box.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Leading Characters</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Layout</td>
      <td>Leading characters</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">LCL</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>All the number cells in the document now have a &pound; sign as their first,
i.e. leading character.</p>

<p>Clear the marked block by clicking Select in the mark block box.</p>

<p>If you wish, you can specify which characters should be used as the
leading characters:</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Options</span> command.</p>

<p>On the <span class="csguide-option">Leading characters</span> line, you will see a box containing the
&pound; sign. This is the leading character that is set when you start PipeDream.</p>

<p>Click Select in the Leading characters box just after the &pound; sign.</p>

<p>Delete the &pound; sign using the <span class="csguide-key">Backspace</span> key and type <span
class="csguide-key">$</span>.</p>

<p>Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>. Now all the number cells have $ as
their leading character.</p>

<p>You may want to give the <span class="csguide-command">Options</span> command
again and change the leading character back to &pound;.</p>

<h2>Column Widths</h2>

<p>When working with spreadsheets, you will often want to adjust the
widths of columns to match the numbers they contain. The quickest
and easiest way to do this with PipeDream is with Auto Width:</p>

<p>First, mark the whole document by clicking Select in the mark block box.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Auto Width</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Layout</td>
      <td>Auto width</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">LAW</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Each column is now the width necessary for the widest entry in that
column.</p>

<p>Clear the marked block by clicking Select in the mark block box.</p>

<p>This facility can be particularly useful when creating very big
spreadsheets with many columns.</p>

<p>Now that your spreadsheet is complete, you can save it if you want to
do so.</p>
