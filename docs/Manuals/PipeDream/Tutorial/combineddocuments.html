<h1>Combined Documents</h1>

<p>Because of its unique design, PipeDream enables you to combine word
processing, database and spreadsheet work and charts within the
same window. No cutting and pasting between different applications
is necessary and operations such as searching and sorting can apply to
all types of work.</p>

<p>The best way to get an idea of what you can achieve by combining
different sorts of work is to create a document consisting of different
types of data yourself.</p>

<p>In this chapter, you are going to produce a report about a survey of
penguins at four Antarctic research stations. The report will require
word processing, spreadsheet work and the production of a chart to
show the results of your survey. You will incorporate a picture into
your document and into your chart and use different fonts to make the
report as attractive as possible.</p>

<p>Before starting check that your computer is equipped with some Outline fonts.
This chapter assumes that you have Trinity and Homerton fonts.
If you have just the system font you can still
work through this chapter but the chart and the final report that you
produce will not be as pretty.</p>

<p>For more information and tutorial about creating charts in PipeDream, look
in the Charts directory in the PipeDream Examples archive.</p>

<p>The final report that we are going to create is shown below:</p>

<hr />

<div><img src="images/pps_newsletter.png" alt="PPS Newsletter" /></div>

<hr />

<p>The document containing the start of the report may be found in the
PipeDream Examples archive.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the PipeDream Examples archive onto your disc drive.</li>
  <li>Make a writable copy of the contents of the archive on your disc drive.
    Open the Examples archive with SparkFS, then simply drag the contents of the
    Example archive to a different location on your disc drive. Close the Examples
    archive directory viewer to avoid confusion!</li>
  <li>Double-click Select on the Tutorial directory icon.</li>
  <li>Double-click Select on the file called Penguins.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first paragraph of the text has been written for you as follows:</p>

<div class="csguide-sample">
<div style="width:48%; margin-left:2em; margin-right:0em; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">

<p>PENGUIN PRESERVATION SOCIETY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
MAY 1991 NEWSLETTER
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During February 1991, the PPS sent a team of researchers to Antarctica,
using the money raised from the highly successful Christmas appeal. Their
task was to highlight the need to preserve this last great wilderness as
a home for penguins.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the final version, the heading is centred.</p>

<p>Position the pointer at the beginning of cell A3 and drag down to A5
until the heading is marked.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Centre Align</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Layout</td>
      <td>Centre align</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">LAC</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Click Select on the mark block box to clear the marked block.</p>

<p>When you move off the heading, you will see that it is centred.</p>

<h2>Fonts</h2>

<p>The final version of the document is displayed in different fonts from
the one you have seen on the screen and on your print-outs so far.
You can set a font for the whole document and also change the font
for individual parts of it, such as headings. The document will be
displayed on the screen and printed out in the font you have chosen.</p>

<p>To set a font for the whole document:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bring up the <span class="csguide-menu">Print</span> menu.</li>
  <li>Move the pointer over the arrow to the right of
    <span class="csguide-menu-option">Font</span>; to see the
    <span class="csguide-dbox">Font Selector</span> dialogue box.</li>
  <li>In the <span class="csguide-option">Font</span> box,
    click Select on <span class="csguide-option">Trinity</span>.</li>
  <li>In the <span class="csguide-option">Weight</span> box,
    click Select on <span class="csguide-option">Medium</span>.</li>
  <li>Use the arrow icons to change the
    <span class="csguide-option">Height</span> setting to 15.</li>
  <li>Use the arrow icons to change the
    <span class="csguide-option">Width</span> setting to 15.</li>
  <li>Click Select on <span class="csguide-option">Auto</span>
    to tell PipeDream to calculate the line height automatically.</li>
  <li>Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>The document will be displayed in 15 point Trinity.Medium.</p>

<p>Because you have changed the font, you need to reformat the text:</p>

<p>Position the caret in cell A8.</p>

<p>Give the Format Paragraph command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Edit</td>
      <td>Format paragraph</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">R</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>To specify a change of font for the heading:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Position the caret at the beginning of cell A3, before the word
    <span style="font-size:15pt;font-family:serif;">PENGUIN</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you move to the line containing the heading, the text will jump
to the left to make it easier to edit.</p>

<ol start="2">
  <li>Bring up the <span class="csguide-option">Print</span> menu.</li>
  <li>Move the pointer over the arrow to the right of the
    <span class="csguide-menu-option">Local Font</span> option in the
    <span class="csguide-menu">Print menu</span> to see the
      <span class="csguide-dbox">Local Font</span> dialogue box.</li>
  <li>In the <span class="csguide-option">Font</span> box,
    click Select on <span class="csguide-option">Homerton</span>.</li>
  <li>In the <span class="csguide-option">Weight</span> box,
    click Select on <span class="csguide-option">Bold</span>.</li>
  <li>In the <span class="csguide-option">Point Size</span> box,
    click Select on 18.</li>
  <li>Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>PipeDream will insert a text @-field in front of the word <code>PENGUIN</code>
which reads <code>@F:Homerton.Bold,18@</code>. This changes the font for this
cell only. When you move off the cell, the text @-field is not displayed.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18pt;font-family:sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">PENGUIN PRESERVATION SOCIETY</span>
is displayed in Homerton 18 point bold.</p>

<ol start="8">
  <li>Repeat the process for cell A5.</li>
</ol>

<p>The whole heading will be displayed in Homerton 18 point Bold.</p>

<h2>Changing column widths</h2>

<p>If you look at the final version, you will see that the second paragraph
is indented. Change the width of column A so that it gives an indent
for the second paragraph.</p>

<p>Move the pointer to the right hand border of column A. The shape of
the pointer will change. Drag Select to the left until the number in the
mark block box changes to 7. If you drag too far to the left, you can
drag back to the right. When you drag column borders in this way, the
mark block box displays the width of the column.</p>

<p>Column A now has a width of 7.</p>

<p>Now you can start to type in the rest of the document.</p>

<p>Position the caret in cell A13 and then press <span class="csguide-key">Tab</span>.</p>

<p>Type the second paragraph:</p>

<div style="margin-left:2em;width:45%" class="csguide-sample">

<p>To confirm the extremely large number of penguins depending
on Antarctica as a base, the team kept a record of the number
of penguins sighted on our four research bases during
February.</p>
</div>

<p>As you get to the end of the first line, the text will wrap onto the next
line and start from column B.</p>

<h2>Building the Spreadsheet</h2>

<p>The next thing to do is to create a spreadsheet for the data collected
by the research team. This will form the basis for your chart.</p>

<p>With PipeDream, there is no need to switch into a different mode or
load a different program just because you have been typing text and
are now about to create a spreadsheet. Both types of work are carried
out in the same window.</p>

<p>Position the caret in cell B18 and type <span class="csguide-key">Base</span>.</p>

<p>Now press to position the caret in cell C18 and type <span class="csguide-key">Total No</span>.</p>

<p>Type <span class="csguide-key">Week 1</span> into cell D18,
<span class="csguide-key">Week 2</span> into cell E18,
<span class="csguide-key">Week 3</span> into cell F18 and
<span class="csguide-key">Week 4</span> into cell G18</p>

<p>Position the caret in cell B20 and type the name of the first research
station, <span class="csguide-key">Palmer</span>.</p>

<p>Continue until your screen looks like this:</p>

<p>As you will be entering mainly number cell items from now on, it is a
good idea to tell PipeDream to make all new cells number cells:
</p>

<p>Also, as you are going to show numbers of penguins in this
spreadsheet rather than prices, it is best to display the numbers with
no decimal places.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Options</span> command.</p>

<p>Set the <span class="csguide-option">New cell format</span> option
to <span class="csguide-option">Numbers</span>.
This tells PipeDream that when you start typing into a new cell,
it should interpret your entry as a number or a formula.
</p>

<p>Use the arrow icons to change the setting for decimal places to zero.</p>

<p>Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button.</p>

<p>Now you can type in the numbers as shown in the table.</p>

<p>As you can see, you need to make column B wider to accommodate the
names of the bases.</p>

<p>Move the pointer to the right hand border of column B. The shape of
the pointer will change. Drag Select to the right until the number in
the mark block box changes to 17. If you drag too far to the right, you
can drag back to the left. When you drag column borders in this way,
the mark block box displays the width of the column.</p>

<p>Now, position the caret in cell C20.
Click Select on the <span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Function</span> button.
This is the curly <em>f</em> at the top of the window.
Slide off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Maths</span> option.
You will see a list of mathematical functions.
Click Select on <span class="csguide-menu-option">SUM</span>.
Click Select in cell D20. Click Select in cell G20.
The formula line should read <code>SUM(D20G20)</code>.
Click Select on the tick icon.</p>

<p>Drag Select until cells C20 to C23 are marked.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Replicate Down</span> command
from the <span class="csguide-menu">Blocks</span> menu.</p>

<p>Click Select in the mark block box to clear the marked block.</p>

<p>The data in your spreadsheet is now complete.</p>

<p>Mark the whole document by clicking Select in the mark block box.</p>

<p>Then give the <span class="csguide-command">Auto Width</span> command. This ensures that each
column is the best width for the data it contains.</p>

<p>Clear the marked block by clicking Select in the mark block box.</p>

<p>The headings Total No., Week 1, Week 2, Week 3 and Week 4 need
to be right aligned so that they line up with the figures beneath them.</p>

<p>Mark the headings and give the <span class="csguide-command">Right Align</span> command.</p>

<p>After entering so much data, it is wise to save your document.</p>

<p>Also, you are about to produce a chart from a spreadsheet; you can
only do this if the document containing the spreadsheet has been saved.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Save</span> command
(<span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-FS</span> or <span class="csguide-key">F3</span>).</p>

<p>When the <span class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box appears,
click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button.</p>

<h2>Producing the Chart</h2>

<p>Very often, numeric information is more easily understood when
presented in chart form. Now is the time to make a Penguin Graph!</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to mark the block of information you want to be
included in the chart:</p>

<p>Be careful not to include headings which you do not want to have in
the final chart.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">New Chart</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chart</td>
      <td>New chart</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">CHN</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You will see the Chart Editing Window containing your chart. It will
appear as a three-dimensional bar chart.</p>

<p>Use the adjust size icon of the Chart Editing Window to resize the
chart until its appearance is pleasing. Notice that as you resize the
chart editing window, the chart is redrawn and reformatted
appropriately.</p>

<p>You can alter the chart's appearance by selecting any of its parts and
applying settings to them.</p>

<p>First, select the y-axis by clicking Select on it. This is the vertical line
at the left-hand side of the chart on which the numbers are displayed.
When you have selected the axis, it will be outlined by a red dotted line
and Axis 2 will appear in the top left hand corner of the Chart
Editing Window.</p>

<p>With the pointer in the Chart Editing Window, press Menu.</p>

<p>You will see the <span class="csguide-menu">Chart Editing</span> Menu.
Slide off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Selection</span> option.</p>

<p>You will see the <span class="csguide-menu">Selection</span> sub-menu.
Click Select on the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Axis</span> option.</p>

<p>You will see the <span class="csguide-dbox">Axis</span> dialogue box.
If the numbers up the vertical axis do not increase in steps of 1000,
change the <span class="csguide-option">Major tick interval</span> setting to 1000.
Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button.</p>

<p>In the Chart Editing Window, press Menu.
Slide off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Gallery</span> option and
click Select on <span class="csguide-menu-option">Bar...</span>
to bring up the <span class="csguide-dbox">Bar Gallery</span>.
In the <span class="csguide-dbox">Bar Gallery</span>
click Select on the <span class="csguide-option">3-D on</span> button to switch off 3-D.
3-D is good for business charts but not as good for penguins.
Click Select on the icon showing stacked penguins and then
click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button.</p>

<p>Now that your chart is ready, you need to save it into your document.</p>

<p>In the document's window, position the caret in cell B25.</p>

<p>Slide off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Save</span> option
in the <span class="csguide-menu">Chart Editing</span> Menu.</p>

<p>Slide off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Chart</span> option.</p>

<p>Drag the chart's icon into the document window. The chart's icon
looks like a PipeDream icon.</p>

<p>The chart is positioned in your document at the caret position.
You may need to press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>
a few times to scroll the chart into the window.</p>

<p>If the chart does not look right, move back into cell B25 where you will
see something like <code>@G:Pengui_C01,100@</code>.</p>

<p>100 is a percentage scale factor, which instructs PipeDream to draw
the picture at 100% of its normal size. Changing the number rescales
the chart.</p>

<h2>Making Changes to Your Data</h2>

<p>You now have a document consisting of text, spreadsheet and chart.
What is more, both the spreadsheet and the chart are dynamic. If you
receive new information, you can make changes.</p>

<p>For example, you hear from one of your team of researchers that the
figure given for penguins sighted at Dumont d'Urville in the fourth
week of February is wrong. In fact only 720 penguins were seen.</p>

<p>Make this change to your spreadsheet by typing 720 into cell G22.
You will see the total number change accordingly. Also, your chart
will change to reflect the new figure.</p>

<h2>Setting a Font for the Chart</h2>

<p>The text on the chart can be displayed in different fonts in the same
way as the document text.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Edit Chart</span> command:</li>
</ol>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chart</td>
      <td>Edit chart</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">CHE</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You will see a list of charts, probably only containing the name of the
chart you have just produced, Chart 1. Click Select on Chart 1.</p>

<p>The chart will be displayed in the Chart Editing Window.</p>

<ol start="2">
  <li>Select the chart background by clicking Select to the left hand side
    of the y-axis and numbers until the word Chart appears in the
    top left hand corner of the Chart Editing Window. You may find
    this a bit difficult at first - but practice makes perfect! The word
    Chart in the top left hand corner of the window confirms that
    you have selected the correct part of the chart.</li>
  <li>Press Menu.</li>
  <li>Slide off the <span class="csguide-">Selection</span> option.</li>
  <li>Click Select on the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Text style</span> option.
    You will see the <span class="csguide-dbox">Font Selection</span> dialogue box.</li>
  <li>In the <span class="csguide-option">Font</span> box,
    click Select on <span class="csguide-option">Trinity</span>.</li>
  <li>In the <span class="csguide-option">Weight</span> box,
    click Select on <span class="csguide-option">Medium</span>.</li>
  <li>In the <span class="csguide-option">Point Size</span> box,
    click Select on 8.</li>
  <li>Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>The chart is displayed in the font you have chosen.</p>

<p>When you are happy with the appearance of the chart, close the Chart
Editing Window by clicking Select on its close icon.</p>

<h2>Adding a Picture to Your Document</h2>

<p>One final change is to add the Penguin Preservation Society's logo as
a document heading. </p>

<ol>
  <li>If necessary, resize the PipeDream window so that you can see the icon bar.</li>
  <li>Position the caret at the beginning of cell A1.</li>
  <li>Bring up the Examples directory viewer.</li>
  <li>Double-click Select on the Pictures directory to open it.</li>
  <li>Drag the icon called Logo into the window of your document.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pictures of penguins will appear on each side of the title.</p>

<p>At this stage, it is advisable to save your document again.</p>

<h2>Printing the Document</h2>

<p>If your document contains fonts, charts, the grid or pictures,
you need to use a RISC&nbsp;OS printer driver to print it.
Your Penguins document contains fonts, a chart and a picture!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Printer Config</span> command:</li>
</ol>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>

      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Print</td>
      <td>Printer config</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">PD</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ol start="2">
  <li>Set the <span class="csguide-option">Printer type</span> option
    to <span class="csguide-option">RISC&nbsp;OS</span>. Ignore the other options.</li>
  <li>Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button
    or press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ensure that a RISC&nbsp;OS printer driver is loaded. Your printer driver
icon must be on the icon bar. If you do not know how to load a
RISC&nbsp;OS printer driver, consult your RISC&nbsp;OS documentation.</p>

<p>If you are using RISC&nbsp;OS 3, you need to install !Printers from your
applications disc and select an appropriate printer type.</p>

<ol start="4">
  <li>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Print</span> command.</li>
</ol>

<table class="csguide-command-table">

      <td>Print</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">PO</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You will see the <span class="csguide-dbox">Print</span> dialogue box.</p>

<p>At the top of the dialogue box, you will see the type of RISC&nbsp;OS
printer driver currently available. Make sure that this is what you
want.</p>

<p>At this stage, you should not need to change any of the other settings.</p>

<p>Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button.</p>

<p>Assuming your printer is correctly connected to your computer and is
on line, your document will be printed.</p>

<p>You have produced your first Penguin Graphics!</p>
