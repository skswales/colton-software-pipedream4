<h1>The PipeDream Window</h1>

<p>When PipeDream is running in the computer, you will see the blue PipeDream
icon (a large white 4 on a dark blue background, with a column of coloured dots)
installed on the icon bar.</p>

<p>If you do not have the PipeDream icon on the icon bar, find the !PipeDream
icon on your disc or network server and double-click Select on it.</p>

<p>To open a PipeDream document window, click Select on the PipeDream icon on the icon
bar.</p>

<p>Your screen will look something like this:</p>

<div><img src="images/pd_new_window.png" width=683 height=277 alt="PipeDream window" /></div>

<p>What you see is an empty PipeDream document window. It is divided into rows and
columns referred to by A, B, C, etc. from left to right. When you first open a
PipeDream window, only row 1 is displayed.</p>

<p>The part of a document lying in one row and one column is called a cell and
can be referred to by its column and row coordinates, for example B1.</p>

<h2>Columns</h2>

<p>A PipeDream document is made up of cells of two types: text cells and number
cells. Text in a text cell is allowed to overlap any blank cells to its right
up to the right margin position. However, number cells are not allowed to
overlap other columns. It is this very simple distinction between text and
numbers which is at the heart of PipeDream.</p>

<p>It can be helpful to think of each column as being a transparent sheet of
paper overlaying the columns to its left.</p>

<p>Moving the pointer into a cell and clicking Select positions the caret in
the cell, unless there is anything in a text cell to the left which could
overlap the cell containing the pointer. Remember that number cells cannot
overlap cells to the right of them.</p>

<p>Consider the following case:</p>

<div class="csguide-sample">

<table border="0">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr class="csguide-border-colhead">
      <th></th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
      <th>C</th>
      <th>D&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="csguide-border-rowhead">1</th>
      <td><img src="images/caret.png" /></td>
      <td></td>
      <td>          </td>
      <td>             </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="csguide-border-rowhead">2</th>
      <td colspan="2">This text in column A overlaps
        cell B2. </td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="csguide-border-rowhead">3</th>
      <td>Text just in column A.</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="csguide-border-rowhead">4</th>
      <td></td>
      <td>Text in column B.</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="csguide-border-rowhead">5</th>
      <td></td>
      <td class="csguide-sample-number">123.45</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="csguide-border-rowhead">6</th>
      <td class="csguide-sample-number">97.30</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>If you move the pointer into cell C1 and click Select, the caret will be
positioned in cell C1. There is nothing to the left of cell C1 which could
overlap it.</p>

<p>If you move the pointer into cell C2 and click Select, the caret will be
positioned in cell A2 as cell A2 contains text and could overlap cell C2.</p>

<p>If you move the pointer into cell C3 and click Select, the caret will be
positioned in cell A3 as cell A3 contains text and could overlap cell C3.</p>

<p>If you move the pointer into cell C4 and click Select, the caret will be
positioned in cell B4 as cell B4 contains text and could overlap cell C4</p>

<p>If you position the pointer in cell C5 and click Select, the caret will be
positioned in cell C5. Because cell B5 is a number cell, it cannot overlap cell
C5.</p>

<p>If you position the pointer in cell C6 and click Select, the caret will be
positioned in cell C6. Although cell A6 has contents, it is a number cell and
so cannot overlap cell C6.</p>

<p>Clicking <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span>-Select always positions the
caret in the cell containing the pointer. So, in all the above cases, clicking
<span class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span>-Select would position the caret in the
relevant cell in column C.</p>

<h2>Interactive Help</h2>

<p>You can ask for interactive help at any point during your use of PipeDream
by double-clicking Select on the <code>!Help</code> icon in your RISC&nbsp;OS <code>Apps</code>
directory. A window appears which provides information about the part of the
RISC&nbsp;OS desktop or PipeDream window at which you are pointing. For further details about the
RISC&nbsp;OS interactive help system, see your RISC&nbsp;OS User Guide.</p>
