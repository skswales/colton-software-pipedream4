<h1>About This Tutorial</h1>

<p>This tutorial is designed to give you an overall feel for how to use
PipeDream by taking you through several examples which you can try out on the
computer as you are reading. The examples deal separately with word processing,
spreadsheet use and database use before a final example demonstrates
PipeDream's unique capacity to combine the different sorts of work.</p>

<p>The <a href="glossary.html">glossary</a> gives a non-technical explanation of those terms used
throughout the tutorial which you may not have come across before.</p>

<p>If you have used PipeDream before or are an experienced user of other word
processors, spreadsheets or database programs we recommend that you glance
through the appropriate chapters before moving on to the Reference Guide. You
will probably encounter features of PipeDream which are new to you and you will
get a feel for how PipeDream 4 differs from software that you have used
before.</p>

<p>If you haven't used this type of software before, we recommend that you work
through all of the examples in the tutorial. As you do so, you will leam a lot
about the different types of work PipeDream can help you with. You will almost
certainly discover ways of doing things which you hadn't imagined were
possible. Whilst most people try to avoid reading software documentation if
they can, a little extra time spent studying now can save you a lot of time
later on.</p>

<p>The <a href="../refguide/index.html">Reference Guide</a>
is designed for more experienced users who know what
they want to do, but need to be able to look up the details. It lists PipeDream
features in alphabetical order for ease of use. If you require further
information on any aspect of PipeDream use dealt with in the Tutorial, you
should find it in the Reference Guide.</p>
