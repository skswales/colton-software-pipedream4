<h1>Word Processing</h1>

<p>With PipeDream, you enter text simply by typing onto the screen as if it
were a piece of paper in a typewriter, using PipeDream's comprehensive range of
word processing facilities to ensure that your text is just as you want it
before you print it out.</p>

<p>The best way to learn about PipeDream's word processing facilities is to use
them yourself to create a PipeDream document. The document you are going to
create is a letter, as shown below, between the two horizontal lines:</p>
<hr />

<div class="csguide-sample">

<p>Dear Martin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Re: Education '91</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am writing to tell you how much I enjoyed the course Blackboards for
Beginners at the Education '91 conference on Friday. The Beattie SuperBlack is
certainly more versatile than I expected it to be and the course enabled me to
get to grips with it very well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to receiving my new blackboards very soon.</p>

<hr />

<p>PipeDream has a template file which sets up your document for word
processing. A template file is a file which has been prepared with options set
for a particular purpose.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click Menu on the PipeDream icon on the icon bar.</li>
  <li>Slide off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">New document</span>
  option.</li>
  <li>Click Select on the <span class="csguide-option">Text</span> option.</li>
</ol>

<p>A new empty PipeDream window will appear, ready for you to type in the
letter.</p>

<p>Click Select on the toggle size icon to make the window fill the screen.</p>

<p>If you look at the window, you will see that the caret (<img
src="images/caret.png" alt="caret" />) is already positioned in cell A1.
The borders of the current column and row are shown in a different colour.</p>

<p>If you press the <span class="csguide-key">Tab</span> key, the caret moves into
column B. Column B's border is now shown in a different colour.</p>

<p>Press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>. The caret is now positioned on
the second row, row 2, so row 2's border is shown in a different colour.</p>

<h2>Typing the Letter</h2>

<p>Move the pointer into cell A1 and click Select to position the caret in cell
A1 again, ready to type in the letter.</p>

<p>To start, you are going to type the school address on the left-hand side of
the window. Later, you will see how to tell PipeDream to place it automatically
at the right-hand side of the letter.</p>

<p>Type in the first line of the address, remembering that you need to hold
down the <span class="csguide-key">Shift</span> key to get upper-case letters and
to press the <span class="csguide-key">Space&nbsp;Bar</span> to enter a space:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em" class="csguide-sample">Tunstall School,</p>

<p>The letters you type appear at the caret position. If you make a mistake as
you type, use the <span class="csguide-key">Backspace</span> key to delete the
character to the left of the caret. To type in a missing character, position
the caret where you want the missing character to go by moving the pointer to
that position and clicking Select. Then type in the missing character. It is
inserted into the existing text.</p>

<p>To start a new line, press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>. Type the
second line of the address:</p>

<p class="csguide-sample" style="margin-left:2em;">School Lane,</p>

<p>Continue in this way to type the whole address, pressing
<span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> each time you need to start a new line.</p>

<p>When you have completed the address, press
<span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> twice before typing @D@:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;" class="csguide-sample">Tunstall School,</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;" class="csguide-sample">School Lane,</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;" class="csguide-sample">Tunstall,</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;" class="csguide-sample">TU1 45B.</p>

<p class="csguide-sample"></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;" class="csguide-sample">@D@</p>

<p>@D@ is used to represent the date. This 'text @-field' inserts today's date
into the document, as you will see if you press
<span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<p>If you look at the finished copy of the letter shown above, you will see
that the address and date are aligned with the right margin of your document.
The position of the right margin is shown by the down arrow symbol at the right
hand side of the column border.</p>

<p>As all the lines of the address and the date are to be right aligned, it is
best to apply the <span class="csguide-command">Right Align</span> command to
them all at the same time. To do this, you first of all need to mark them as a
block. A block is a group of cells upon which some commands can operate.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Position the pointer at the start of cell A1.</li>
  <li>Drag Select until the pointer is at the end of the text in cell A6.</li>
  <li>Press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> repeatedly to position the
    caret on row 7.</li>
</ol>

<p>The whole address and the date are now 'marked as a block' and shown on a
black background.</p>

<p>Now give the <span class="csguide-command">Right Align</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Layout</td>
      <td>Right align</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">LAR</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>As you can see, the address and date are now aligned with the right
margin.</p>

<p>Try moving onto one of the lines of the address. When you move onto the
line, it is displayed with left alignment. When you move off it, it is
displayed with right alignment again.</p>

<p>PipeDream always displays the current text cell with left alignment so that
you can edit it easily.</p>

<p>Move onto the date line. When you move onto it, you can see that you
actually typed in @D@ and not the date shown. Moving off the line displays
today's date again.</p>

<p>PipeDream always displays the current text cell without expanded text
@-fields so that you can edit it easily.</p>

<p>Now you need to clear the marked block. Do this by clicking Select on the
mark block box.</p>

<p>Now you can type in the address to which the letter is to be sent. This
time, simply type in each line of the address and then press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span> to move to the next line. If you make any
mistakes as you type, you may find the following commands useful:</p>

<p>Delete Character:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Edit</td>
      <td>Delete character</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">G</span></td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">Shift-Backspace</span></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This deletes the character to the right of the caret.</p>

<p>Delete Word:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Edit</td>
      <td>Delete word</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">T</span></td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">F10</span></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This deletes from the caret position to the start of the next word.</p>

<p>Swap Case:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Edit</td>
      <td>Swap case</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">SS</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This changes the case of the character at the caret position, from
upper-case to lower-case and vice versa.</p>

<p>If you want to change the case of a lot of letters, you can use the <span
class="csguide-command">Repeat Command</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Files</td>
      <td>Repeat command</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">J</span></td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">F5</span></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This repeats the command just given. It is easier to press <span
class="csguide-key">F5</span> or <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-J</span>
repeatedly than <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-SS</span>.</p>

<p>When you have finished typing the address, press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span> twice to position the caret on row 15 and
type</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;" class="csguide-sample">Dear Martin,</p>

<p>Again, press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> twice before typing</p>

<p class="csguide-sample" style="margin-left:2em;">Re: Education '91</p>

<p>If you look at the finished version of the letter above, you will see that
the text on this line of the letter is centred and printed in bold type.</p>

<p>To centre the text, position the caret in cell A17.</p>

<p>Drag Select across the cell to mark it.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Centre Align</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Layout</td>
      <td>Centre align</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">LAC</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>To embolden the text, position the caret at the start of cell A16 and give
the <span class="csguide-command">Bold</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Print</td>
      <td>Bold</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">PB</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span>. The text will appear
centred and displayed in bold type.</p>

<p>Press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> again and you are ready to
type the main body of the letter. As you do so, notice that you do not need to
press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> at the end of each line as the
text automatically &lsquo;wraps&rsquo; onto the next line at the right margin
position. You only need to press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> when
you want to force a new line.</p>

<p>At the end of the first paragraph, you will need to press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span> twice to create a blank line before starting
to type the next paragraph.</p>

<p>Continue to type until you have completed the letter.</p>

<h2>Checking Your Spelling</h2>

<p>Once the letter is complete, it is a good idea to check that you have not
made any spelling or typing mistakes. Making mistakes is very easy if you are
not a trained typist. It is also amazingly easy not to notice spelling mistakes
when checking over your own document. You seem to see what you expect to see
rather than what is really there! To check that your document is correctly
spelt, give the <span class="csguide-command">Check Document</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Spell</td>
      <td>Check document</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">SC</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you are working with removable media, you will be asked to insert the
media containing the !PipeDream application directory so that PipeDream can read its
dictionary.</p>

<p>When the dialogue box appears, click the <span
class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button. PipeDream starts at the top of the document
and checking proceeds word by word through the document until it comes across a
word which is not in its dictionary. As far as PipeDream is concemed, a word
which does not appear in its dictionary is not correct. Obviously, the
PipeDream dictionary cannot include proper names such as Tunstall, so checking
will stop almost immediately and the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Checking</span> dialogue box will be displayed. In this
instance, the word shown in the dialogue box (Tunstall) is fine so click the
<span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button to accept the word as it is.
PipeDream will now remember this word so it will not stop at the next
occurrence of it.</p>

<p>If PipeDream stops at a word which is incorrectly spelt, you can edit the
word and then click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Change word</span>
button in the <span class="csguide-dbox">Checking</span> dialogue box. The word in
the document will be changed.</p>

<p>Now that you have completed your letter and checked that you have not made
any spelling mistakes, you will want to save it so that you have a permanent
copy of it.</p>

<h2>Saving Your Letter</h2>

<p>To save the letter:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you are working with removable media, you may need to insert the media
    onto which you want to save the file.</li>
  <li>Shrink the PipeDream document window so that you can see the icon bar.</li>
  <li>Click Select on the hard disc icon, network server icon or other media
    icon depending on where you want to save the PipeDream file.</li>
  <li>If you want to save your file into a sub-directory on the disc,
    double-click Select on the sub-directory.</li>
  <li>The directory viewer will appear on the screen. This is a window
    displaying the contents of the directory.</li>
  <li>Move or resize the PipeDream window so that you can see both the
    directory viewer and the PipeDream window.</li>
  <li>With the pointer in the PipeDream window, give the <span
    class="csguide-command">Save</span> command:</li>
</ol>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>

    <tr>
      <td>Files</td>
      <td>Save</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">FS</span></td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">F3</span></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<ol start="8">
  <li>The easiest way to give this command is by pressing the <span
    class="csguide-key">F3</span> key. You will see the <span
    class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box.</li>
  <li>The caret is positioned in the box where you should type the name you
    want the file to have. Delete <code>Untitled1</code> using the <span
    class="csguide-key">Backspace</span> key.</li>
  <li>Type in the name you want to give to the file. You might give it the name
    <code>Beattie</code> .</li>
  <li>Move the pointer to the file's icon in the top left hand corner of the
    <span class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box.</li>
  <li>Press and hold Select and drag the file's icon into the directory viewer.</li>
  <li>Release Select.</li>
</ol>

<p>The pointer may change to an hourglass to show you that the file is being
saved.</p>

<p>If you look at the directory viewer, you will see that there is a PipeDream
icon in it with the name Beattie.</p>

<p>You now have a permanent copy of the letter stored on your disc or network
server.</p>

<p>Click Select on the close icon of the PipeDream window.</p>

<h2>Loading and Editing the Letter</h2>

<p>Double-click Select on the PipeDream icon called Beattie.</p>

<p>A PipeDream window will appear on the screen containing the letter you have
just typed and saved. It has the name <em><code>directory</code></em>.Beattie,
<em><code>directory</code></em> being the pathname of the directory into which
you saved it.</p>

<p>Now that you have the letter on the screen again, you can make any further
changes to it you require. Suppose that you decide the letter would be better
with just one paragraph of text instead of two.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Position the caret in the blank line between the two paragraphs.</li>
  <li>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Delete Row</span> command:</li>
</ol>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>

      <td><span class="csguide-key">Y</span></td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">F8</span></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The blank line between the two paragraphs disappears.</p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Move the caret up one line.</li>
</ol>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Format Paragraph</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Edit</td>
      <td>Format paragraph</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">R</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Your letter would probably look neater with justification switched on. This
gives it an even right-hand margin. Give the <span
class="csguide-command">Options</span> command.</p>

<p>Switch on justification by clicking Select on the option icon next to <span
class="csguide-option">Justify</span>.</p>

<p>Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<p>Position the caret at the beginning of the main part of the letter, just
before <code>I am writing</code>.</p>

<p>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Format Paragraph</span> command.</p>

<p>The paragraph will now have an even right-hand margin.</p>

<p>Having made these final changes, you can save the document again to ensure
that the permanent copy on disc is up to date.</p>

<p>This time you do not need to use the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box. Instead, you can simply click
Select on the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Save</span> option in the <span
class="csguide-menu">Files</span> menu.</p>

<p>PipeDream will automatically save the file in the directory into which you
dragged its icon earlier.</p>

<h2>Printing the Letter</h2>

<p>The final thing to do is to print out the letter which you have now
completed.</p>

<p>Take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Give the <span class="csguide-command">Printer Config</span> command
    (config is short for configuration):</li>
</ol>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Print</td>
      <td>Printer config</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">PD</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This dialogue box is where you tell PipeDream about your printer so that
printing can be carried out accordingly.</p>

<ol start="2">
  <li>On the <span class="csguide-option">Printer type</span> line, you
click Select on the arrow icons to set the option to <span
class="csguide-option">Serial</span>, <span
class="csguide-option">Parallel</span> or <span
class="csguide-option">Network</span>. Most printers are connected to your
RISC&nbsp;OS computer via a 'Parallel port'. Set the option to Parallel unless you
know that you have a Serial printer or are printing on an Econet.</li>

  <li>On the <span class="csguide-option">Printer driver</span> line, use
the arrow icons to choose the name of the printer driver you are going to use.
The printer driver acts as an interface between PipeDream and your printer so
what you should choose here depends on the kind of printer you are using.
Choose <span class="csguide-option">Daisywheel</span> if you are using a
daisywheel printer. Choose <span class="csguide-option">DotMatrix</span> if
you are using a dot matrix printer. Choose <span
class="csguide-option">HPJet</span> if you are using a Hewlett Packard Deskjet
or Laserjet or compatible printer.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this stage, don't worry about the other settings in the Printer Config
