<h1>Charts</h1>

<p>PipeDream enables you to produce many types of chart from your spreadsheets;
you can produce pie charts, bar charts, line charts, scatter charts and overlay
charts.</p>

<p>For each type of chart, you can choose from a wide variety of styles by
selecting the style you want from a gallery, in which you can see examples of
the possible styles for the chart type you have chosen.</p>

<p>Once you have produced a chart, you can resize it and edit each part of it
individually. You also have a great deal of control over the final appearance
of your chart in terms of colour, text style and fill style.</p>

<p>Indeed, PipeDream provides all the facilities you need to produce exactly
the chart you want.</p>

<p>The charts you produce are dynamic, i.e. any changes made to the spreadsheet
data on which they are based are reflected in the charts themselves.</p>

<h2>Producing a Chart From a PipeDream Spreadsheet</h2>

<p>1. Mark the block of spreadsheet data from which you want to produce a
chart.</p>

<p>Note that if there are more rows than columns or an equal number of rows and
columns in the marked block, PipeDream assumes that the categories (i.e. the
x-data) run across the columns. If any of the cells in the leftmost column of
the marked block are text cells, PipeDream assumes that the column contains the
category labels. If any of the cells in the top row of the marked block are
text cells, PipeDream assumes that the row contains the series labels, normally
only seen in legends or 3-D charts.</p>

<p>If there are more columns than rows in the marked block, PipeDream assumes
that the categories (i.e. the x-data) run down the rows from the top of the
marked block. If any of the cells in the top row of the marked block are text
cells, PipeDream assumes that the row contains the category labels. If any of
the cells in the leftmost column of the marked block are text cells, PipeDream
assumes that the column contains the series labels, normally only seen in
legends or 3-D charts.</p>

<p>2. Give the <span class="csguide-command">New Chart</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Charts</td>
      <td>New Chart</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">CHN</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The chart editing window is displayed, containing the chart produced from
the marked block of spreadsheet data. The chart type used is the preferred
chart type. If you have not yet set a preferred chart type, PipeDream displays
a bar chart. The chart displayed in the chart editing window becomes the
current chart, i.e. any chart commands you give will be applied only to this
chart.</p>

<h2>Altering a Chart by Altering Data in PipeDream</h2>

<p>If you make a change to any PipeDream cell in the block from which a chart
was produced, the chart is reformatted and redisplayed, taking account of the
change you have made.</p>

<p>If you insert rows or columns into the block from which a chart was
produced, new entries are made in the chart. If you delete rows or columns from
the block, the corresponding entries are removed from the chart.</p>

<p>Note that the same block can be used to produce more than one chart.</p>

<h2>Selecting a Chart</h2>

<p>You can select a chart. This makes it the current chart, so that any
commands you give will operate upon it.</p>

<p>1. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Select Chart</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Charts</td>
      <td>Select Chart</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">CHS</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You will see a list of all the charts currently in memory.</p>

<p>If one of the charts is within a PipeDream document, the leafname of the
document is shown in brackets. For example, <code>[Penguins]BarChart1</code>
represents a chart called 'BarChart1' within the document 'Penguins'.</p>

<p>If a chart appears in more than one PipeDream document, a number is
displayed next to the chart's name to indicate how many documents contain
it.</p>

<p>2. Click Select on the name of the chart you want to select.</p>

<p>The chart you have chosen becomes the current chart.</p>

<h2>Adding Data to a Chart</h2>

<p>You can add more PipeDream spreadsheet data to a chart:</p>

<p>1. Mark the block of spreadsheet data you want to add to the chart.</p>

<p>2. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Add to Chart</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th>Command (long menu)</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Charts</td>
      <td>Add to Chart</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">CHA</code></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you have produced other charts previously, you will see a list of all
available charts, as you do when you give the <span
class="csguide-command">Select Chart</span> command.</p>

<p>You can choose a chart from this list by clicking Select on its name. If you
do so, the chart you choose becomes the current chart.</p>

<p>The current chart is redrawn to take account of the new data which has been
added to it.</p>

<h2>Removing Data From a Chart</h2>

<p>You can remove PipeDream spreadsheet data from a chart:</p>

<p>1. Mark the block of spreadsheet data you want to remove from the chart.</p>

<p>2. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Remove from Chart</span>
command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you have produced other charts previously, you will see a list of all
available charts, as you do when you give the <span
class="csguide-command">Select Chart</span> command.</p>

<p>You can choose a chart from this list by clicking Select on the chart's
name. If you do so, the chart you choose becomes the current chart.</p>

<p>The current chart is redrawn to take account of the data which has been
removed from it.</p>

<h2>Deleting a Chart</h2>

<p>To delete the current chart, give the <span class="csguide-command">Delete
Chart</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />

<h2>Editing a Chart</h2>

<p>To edit a chart:</p>

<p>1. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Edit Chart</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />

      <td>Edit Chart</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">CHE</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you have produced other charts previously, you will see a list of all
available charts, as you do when you give the <span
class="csguide-command">Select Chart</span> command.</p>

<p>You can choose a chart from this list by clicking Select on the chart's
name. If you do so, the chart you choose becomes the current chart.</p>

<p>2. If you want to edit a chart other than the current chart, click Select on
the name of the chart you want to edit.</p>

<p>The <span class="csguide-dbox">Chart Editing Window</span> is displayed
containing the current chart.</p>

<p>If you resize the window, PipeDream resizes and reformats the chart
appropriately.</p>

<h2>Altering the type of your chart</h2>

<p>To change the type of your chart:</p>

<p>1. Click Menu in the <span class="csguide-dbox">Chart Editing Window</span> to bring up the <span class="csguide-menu">Chart Editing</span> Menu.</p>

<p>2. Slide off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Gallery</span> option to
bring up the <span class="csguide-menu">Gallery</span> sub-menu</p>

<p>3. If you want to restore the preferred chart type, click Select on the
<span class="csguide-menu-option">Preferred</span> option. If you want to set a
different chart type, slide off the appropriate option.</p>

<p>Unless you clicked on <span class="csguide-menu-option">Preferred</span>, the
<span class="csguide-dbox">Gallery</span> dialogue box for the chart type you chose is displayed.</p>

<h3>Pie</h3>

<p>The <span class="csguide-dbox">Pie Gallery</span> dialogue box displays
pictures of eight styles of pie chart. Choose the style closest to the final
result you want by clicking Select on the appropriate picture.</p>

<p>The remaining options in the dialogue box enable you to fine-tune your pie
chart so that you get exactly what you want.</p>

<p>You can specify that all sectors, or a selected sector, of the pie chart
should be exploded by a given distance or brought back to the centre. Use the
<span class="csguide-option">All</span> and <span
class="csguide-option">Selection</span> radio buttons and the <span
class="csguide-option">Distance</span> box to make these settings.</p>

<p>You can choose whether the pie chart should run clockwise or anti-clockwise
and specify the starting angle. Either click Select on the radio buttons to
select a 12, 3, 6 or 9 o'clock starting angle, type in a number or use the
arrow icons to set the angle you require. Note that the number specifies a
clockwise bearing in the same way as a compass, i.e. 0 at the top, 90 at the
middle right, etc.</p>

<h3>Bar</h3>

<p>The <span class="csguide-dbox">Bar Gallery</span> dialogue box displays
pictures of the available styles of bar chart. Choose the style closest to the
final result you want by clicking Select on the appropriate picture.</p>

<p>The remaining dialogue box options enable you to set the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the percentage overlap between adjacent bar slots in a category</li>
</ul>

<p>This can be positive to space the bar slots out, zero to have the bar slots
abutting each other or negative to have the bar slots overlapping. A setting of
100% would make the bar slots overlap completely. This setting does not apply
to 3-D bar charts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>the percentage width of bars in their slots</li>
</ul>

<p>A setting of zero would make the bars very thin; a setting of 100% would
make them fill their slots. This setting also applies to 3-D bar charts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>the percentage depth of bars in their slots</li>
</ul>

<p>A setting of zero would make the bars very thin; a setting of 100% would
make them fill their slots. This setting applies only to 3-D bar charts.</p>

<p>If a fill style (see below) using a picture has been chosen, you can specify
whether the picture is stretched vertically to fill the bar or whether the
number of copies of the picture used to fill the bar is dependent on the bar
value.</p>
<ul>
  <li>3-D</li>
</ul>

<p>Click on the 3-D option icon to turn 3-D on or off.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you select 3-D, you can change two further parameters that control the view.
    The chart can be turned about a vertical axis and the front of the chart can be drooped forwards.
    Either use the arrow icons to set these parameters or type in the number of
  degrees.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Line</h3>

<p>The <span class="csguide-dbox">Line Gallery</span> dialogue box displays
pictures of the available styles of line and point chart. Point charts are line
charts without the lines between points. Choose the style closest to the final
result you want by clicking Select on the appropriate picture.</p>

<p>The remaining dialogue box options enable you to set the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In 3-D, the percentage depth of lines in their slots</li>
</ul>

<p>This gives a ribbon which can be filled in a solid colour. The line style
and line colour settings only affect the lines bounding the ribbon.</p>
<ul>
  <li>droplines</li>
</ul>

<p>If this option is set, lines are dropped from each data point to the
category axis.</p>

<h3>Scatter</h3>

<p>The <span class="csguide-dbox">Scatter Gallery</span> dialogue box
displays pictures of the available styles of scatter chart. Choose the style
closest to the final result you want by clicking Select on the appropriate
picture.</p>

<p>In scatter charts, points are plotted at x and y positions corresponding to
their numeric input pair, rather than using labelled categories. The points may
be joined by lines in the style you select (see below). Note that the x-data is
not sorted by PipeDream, so if the input x-data is not sorted, the lines
joining the points may go backwards from right to left as well as from left to
right.</p>

<p>In the dialogue box you can select the x-error bar and y-error bar
independently. These take additional values and are used to draw error bars of
the given length in the x and/or y directions.</p>

<h3>Overlays</h3>

<p>The <span class="csguide-dbox">Overlays Gallery</span> dialogue box
displays pictures of the available styles of overlay chart. Choose the style
closest to the final result you want by clicking Select on the appropriate
picture.</p>

<p>The series in the chart are repartitioned such that not more than half of
them are moved to the overlay chart. Overlays have chart type, axes and scaling
independent of the main chart. Pie charts cannot be overlaid or used as
overlays.</p>

<p>To remove the overlay from a chart, use the <span
class="csguide-dbox-option">Remove overlay</span> button in the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Line Gallery</span>, <span
class="csguide-dbox">Bar Gallery</span> or <span
class="csguide-dbox">Scatter Gallery</span> dialogue boxes.
All series will then be put back into the main chart.</p>

<p>Selecting any kind of pie will force overlays to be removed.</p>

<h2>Changing the style of your chart</h2>

<p>You can change the style of any part of your chart:</p>

<p>1. Click Select on the part of the chart you want to change.</p>

<p>You can select the chart background, plot area, individual axes, series,
etc.</p>

<p>Series are numbered from 1, so series 1 is called S1.</p>

<p>Points within a series can be selected individually by clicking Adjust on
them. S2P4 refers to point 4 in series 2.</p>

<p>Axes are numbered from 1 to 6. The numbering depends on whether 3-D is set
and whether there are any overlays:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Axis 1 is always the main category x-axis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Axis 2 is always the main value y-axis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Axis 3 is the main series z-axis if 3-D is set or,
if not, an overlay category axis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Axis 4 is an overlay category axis if 3-D is set
or, if not, an overlay value axis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Axis 5 is an overlay value axis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Axis 6 is an overlay series axis.</p>

<p>2. Bring up the <span class="csguide-menu">Selection</span> sub-menu by sliding off the <span
class="csguide-menu-option">Selection</span> option in the <span
class="csguide-menu">Chart Editing</span> menu.</p>

<p>The <span class="csguide-menu">Selection</span> sub-menu options which
you cannot apply to your selected part will be greyed out. You can apply all
the other options to it.</p>

<h3>Fill colour</h3>

<p>If you click Select on this option, you will see the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Colour Selection</span> dialogue box which you can use
to alter the solid colour used to fill an object such as the background of the
plot area or the insides of the bars in a bar chart. Use the sliders to drag
the <span class="csguide-dbox-option">R</span>, <span
class="csguide-dbox-option">G</span> and <span
class="csguide-dbox-option">B</span>
values from 0 to 255 or use the arrow icons.</p>

<p>When you have made the settings you require, click the <span
class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<h3>Fill style</h3>

<p>If you click Select on this option, you will see the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Fill Style</span> dialogue box which you can use to
specify whether filled objects should be filled with a solid colour or with a
picture. Click on the <span class="csguide-dbox-option">Solid</span> button to
specify the former or on the <span class="csguide-dbox-option">Picture</span>
button to specify the latter. If you select pictures, you will be able to
scroll through the files available for use as fill patterns.</p>

<p>When you have made the settings you require, click the <span
class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<p>If you want to use your own picture as a fill pattern, drag your Draw file
into the Chart Editing window.</p>

<h3>Line colour</h3>

<p>If you click Select on this option, you will see the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Colour Selection</span> dialogue box which you can use
to alter the colour used for objects such as the borders around the plot area,
the legend border, the grid lines and the outsides of bars in bar charts.</p>

<p>When you have made the settings you require, click the <span
class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<h3>Line style</h3>

<p>If you click Select on this option, you will see the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Line Style</span> dialogue box. This has options for
pattern and thickness. Five patterns are given, one of which is solid; the
other four are dashed patterns.</p>

<p>Thickness is specified in points. You can type in a number or choose the
picture of the line thickness you want.</p>

<p>When you have made the settings you require, click the <span
class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<h3>Legend</h3>

<p>The <span class="csguide-menu-option">Legend</span> option in the <span
class="csguide-menu">Chart Editing</span> menu can be turned on or off by
clicking Select on it. If it is turned on, a tick appears next to its name.
Sliding off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Legend</span> option brings up
the <span class="csguide-menu">Legend</span> sub-menu.</p>

<p>This sub-menu has only one option - <span class="csguide-menu-option">Arrange
vertically</span> - which you can switch on or off by clicking Select on it. If
it is switched on, a tick appears next to it.</p>

<p>To reposition a legend, select it and drag it into place.</p>

<h2>Adding and Editing text in your chart</h2>

<p>You can create new text, such as chart titles, anywhere within the chart
area in any style:</p>

<p>1. Give the <span class="csguide-command">New Text</span> command from the
Chart Editing window.</p>

<p>2. In the Text Window, type in the text you require.</p>

<p>3. Click on the <span class="csguide-toolbar-button">tick</span> icon.</p>

<p>The text will be placed in the chart at the point where you brought up the
menu. You can alter its position later by selecting it and dragging it</p>

class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<h3>Hint colour</h3>

<p>If you click Select on this option, you will see the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Colour Selection</span> dialogue box which you can use
to alter background hint colour. This is used to improve the appearance of
antialiased font rendering on screen. For example, if white text is displayed
on a blue background, it is best to set the hint colour to blue, especially in
256 colour modes.</p>

<p>When you have made the settings you require, click the <span
class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<h2>To control the axes of your chart</h2>

<p>1. Select the axis by clicking Select on it.</p>

<p>2. Click the Menu button to bring up the <span
class="csguide-menu">Chart Editing</span> menu.</p>

<p>3. Slide off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Selection</span> option to

<p>4. Slide off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Axis</span> option.</p>

<p>You will see the <span class="csguide-dbox">Axis</span> dialogue box in
which you can set the axis control attributes.</p>

<p>You can specify the position of the axis, to the left or right of the plot
area or as close to zero as possible.</p>

<p>You can turn log (base 10) scaling of an axis on or off for a selected axis.
Note that log scaling turns off all other axis scaling and interval options.</p>

<p>You can turn autoscaling on or off for a selected axis.</p>

<p>If autoscaling is turned off, the chart uses the specified minimum and
maximum values on that axis. If the actual data values fall outside this range,
the range used to plot the graph is increased accordingly to ensure that all
your data is plotted sensibly.</p>

<p>You can turn grid lines on or off for an axis.</p>

<p>You can turn major and minor ticks on or off for an axis.</p>

<p>You can specify whether these ticks are to the left (or bottom), right (or
top) or centred on the axis.</p>

<p>You can specify the major and minor tick intervals which are used if the
autointerval option is turned off. Note that if major ticks are turned off
minor ticks are also turned off.</p>

<p>When you have made the settings you require, click the <span
class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<h2>Saving Your Chart</h2>

<p>You can save your chart, as a 'live' dynamic chart or as a 'dead' Draw file,
into a PipeDream document.</p>

<p>To save a dynamic chart into a PipeDream document:</p>

<p>1. Open the window of the PipeDream document into which you want to insert
the chart.</p>

<p>2. Position the caret at the top left of where you want the chart
positioned.</p>

<p>3. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Save</span> command from the <span
class="csguide-menu">Chart Editing</span> menu.</p>

<p>4. Slide off the chart option.</p>

<p>5. Drag the chart's icon into the PipeDream document window.</p>

<p>This inserts an <code>@G</code> reference to the chart file.</p>

<p>Whenever the chart is updated, those PipeDream document windows which contain it are redrawn. You can adjust the <code>@G</code> reference to rescale the chart, just as you can with Draw files.</p>

<p>You can copy the chart into more than one document.</p>

<p>To save a 'dead' Draw file into a PipeDream document, proceed as above,
sliding off the <span class="csguide-menu-option">Draw file</span> option in the
<span class="csguide-menu">Save</span> sub-menu.</p>

<p>You can also save the chart as a 'dead' Draw file into a file or into
another application such as Draw.</p>

<p>To save charts as files to disc, drag their icons into the required
directory.</p>
