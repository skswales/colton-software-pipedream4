<h1>First Word Plus Format</h1>

<p>PipeDream can load and save files in First Word Plus format. As with most
file conversion between different applications, it is not possible to perform a
perfect conversion because the two programs have different philosophies and
structures. However, the converter does ease the task of passing text between
the two applications considerably.</p>

<h2>Loading a First Word Plus File</h2>

<p>To load a First Word Plus file, drag the file's icon from its directory to
the PipeDream icon on the icon bar. All First Word Plus files have a
recognisable header at the beginning, so the PipeDream auto-loader should have
no trouble determining that the file is a First Word Plus file.</p>

<p>After loading the file, you will probably want to save it in PipeDream
format. It is best to save the file immediately. Bring up the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box, change the filename, click
Select on the <span class="csguide-option">PipeDream</span> format option and
then click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<p>PipeDream extracts all the text and most of the highlighting information
from the file. It should also recover some of the page layout information such
as the page length, margins, header and footer.</p>

<h2>Saving a First Word Plus File</h2>

<p>To save a file in First Word Plus format, first bring up the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box. Check that the filename is
what you need. You will probably not want to save your First Word Plus file on
top of the PipeDream file that you loaded. Click Select on the <span
class="csguide-option">1WP</span> format option. Click the <span
class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.
The file will be saved in First Word Plus format.</p>

<p>PipeDream saves out all the text and all your highlights. It also tries to
send out page layout information such as page length, margins, header and
footer. PipeDream sends column information out separated by Tabs. Note that,
because First Word Plus cannot store and save Tabs (it converts them to
spaces), you will not be able to edit the file in First Word Plus, reload it
into PipeDream and maintain all the column information.</p>
