<h1>Financial Functions</h1>

<p>The following financial functions are provided. Note that there is an
example of each financial function in the PipeDream Examples archive.</p>

<h2>CTERM</h2>

<p><code>CTERM(<span class="csguide-arg">interest</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">fv</span>, <span class="csguide-arg">pv</span>)</code></p>

<p>Calculates the number of compounding periods required for an investment at a
present value (<span class="csguide-arg">pv</span>) to reach a future value
(<span class="csguide-arg">fv</span>) earning a fixed interest rate (<span
class="csguide-arg">interest</span>).</p>

<p>For example, how long does it take to turn &pound;1000 into &pound;2000 at a fixed rate
of 10% per year? The answer is calculated with the formula
<code>CTERM(0.10,2000,1000)</code>. The answer in this case is 7.27 years.</p>


<h1>DDB</h1>

<p><code>DDB(<span class="csguide-arg">cost</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">salvage</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">life</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">period</span>)</code></p>

<p>Calculates the depreciation allowance on an asset at a specific period of
time using the double declining balance method.</p>

<p>For example, you pay &pound;5000 for a machine that will have a salvage value of
&pound;1000 at the end of 5 years. What is the depreciation in the first year? The
formula to find out is <code>DDB(5000,1000,5,1)</code> which returns &pound;2000, the
depreciation allowance for the first year.</p>


<h2>FV</h2>

<p><code>FV(<span class="csguide-arg">payment</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">interest</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">term</span>)</code></p>

<p>Computes the future value of an investment based on a number of equal
payments, each earning interest at a periodic rate, over a specified term.</p>

<p>For example, you put &pound;400 annually into an account which earns 5% per annum.
What is the value of the account after 25 years? The formula
<code>FV(400,0.05,25)</code> calculates the result, &pound;19,090.84.</p>


<h2>IRR</h2>

<p><code>IRR(<span class="csguide-arg">guess</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">range</span>)</code></p>

<p>Calculates the internal rate of return of an investment, and series of
calculations based on an initial guess.</p>

<p>For example, cell A1 contains the initial investment -5000 (entered as a
negative number because you are spending it). Cells A2 - A14 each contain the
number 500, representing payments returned on the investment. Cell A16 contains
the number .01, a first guess for the internal rate of return. The formula
<code>IRR(A16,A1A14)</code> displays the result 0.04, the internal percentage
rate of return for the cash flows in column A.</p>


<h2>MIRR</h2>

<p><code>MIRR(values_array,finance_rate,reinvest_rate)</code></p>

<p>Returns the modified internal rate of return for a series of periodic cash
flows. MIRR considers both the cost of the investment and the interest received
on reinvestment of the cash. <span class="csguide-arg">values_array</span> is
an array or a reference to cells which contain numbers. The numbers represent a
series of payments (negative values) and income (positive values) occurring at
regular periods. <span class="csguide-arg">finance_rate</span> is the interest
rate you pay on the money used in the cash flows. <span
class="csguide-arg">reinvest_rate</span> is the interest rate you receive on
the cash flows as you reinvest them.</p>

<p>For example: you are a potter just completing your third year in business.
Three years ago, you borrowed &pound;120,000 at 10% annual interest to buy a workshop
and equipment. Your annual income for the past three years has been &pound;39,000,
&pound;30,000, and &pound;21,000. During these years, you reinvested your profits, earning
12% annually. If you enter the initial cost as a negative number in cell B1 and
the annual incomes in cells B2, B3 and B4, to calculate the investment's
modified rate of return after 3 years, you would type
<code>MIRR(B1B4,.10,.12)</code> which would return -0.04804 as the result.</p>


<h2>NPV</h2>

<p><code>NPV(<span class="csguide-arg">interest</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">range</span>)</code></p>

<p>Calculates the net present value of a series of future cash flows at a fixed
period interest rate.</p>

<p>For example, cells B10 - B14 each contain the number 120 each representing a
cash flow. What is the net present value of the cash flows given a discount
rate of 10%? The formula <code>NPV(0.10,B10B14)</code> displays the result
&pound;454.89, the present value of the future cash flows.</p>

<h2>PMT</h2>

<p><code>PMT(<span class="csguide-arg">principal</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">interest</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">term</span>)</code></p>

<p>Calculates the payment on a loan given the principal, periodic interest rate
and number of terms.</p>

<p>To calculate monthly payments given an annual percentage rate, and a term in
years, divide the interest rate by 12 and multiply the term by 12.</p>

<p>For example, what is the monthly payment on a loan of &pound;150,000, given a 10%
annual interest rate and a term of 20 years? The formula
<code>PMT(150000,0.10/12,20*12)</code> returns the correct monthly payment,
&pound;1447.53.</p>


<h2>PV</h2>

<p><code>PV(<span class="csguide-arg">payment</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">interest</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">term</span>)</code></p>

<p>Computes the present value of a series of equal payments discounted at a
periodic interest rate for a term.</p>

<p>For example, you are considering starting a trust fund for your grandson,
where you pay &pound;2000 a year for 30 years. Given that you could earn 12% by
investing your money elsewhere, what is the present value of the trust fund,
including the interest that you won't earn? The formula
<code>PV(2000,0.12,30)</code> returns &pound;16110.37, the cash value of the trust
fund in today's pounds.</p>


<h2>RATE</h2>

<p><code>RATE(<span class="csguide-arg">fv</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">pv</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">term</span>)</code></p>

<p>Calculates the periodic interest required for an investment at a present
value (<span class="csguide-arg">pv</span>) to reach a future value (<span
class="csguide-arg">fv</span>) within a certain period of time (<span
class="csguide-arg">term</span>).</p>

<p>For example, 25 years from now, you want to retire with &pound;1,000,000 in the
bank. You have &pound;50,000 to put into a pension fund. How much interest
(compounded monthly) will you need to earn to accumulate the million pounds?
The answer is given by the formula <code>RATE(1000000,50000,25*12)</code> . The
answer is 0.01, which you multiply by 12 to get the annual interest rate of 12%
(0.12).</p>


<h2>SLN</h2>

<p><code>SLN(<span class="csguide-arg">cost</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">salvage</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">life</span>)</code></p>

<p>Computes the straight line depreciation allowance of an asset for any given
period, given the cost, the predicted salvage value and life of the asset.</p>

<p>For example, you buy a computer for &pound;500 which has a salvage value of &pound;100
in five years. In any given year, the depreciation allowance is given by the
formula <code>SLN(500,100,5)</code> which returns &pound;80.00.</p>


<h2>SYD</h2>

<p><code>SYD(<span class="csguide-arg">cost</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">salvage</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">life</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">period</span>)</code></p>

<p>Determines the depreciation allowance of a given year using the
sum-of-years' digits method.</p>

<p>For example, you purchase a &pound;500 computer that has a salvage value of &pound;100
after five years. The depreciation allowance for the first year is given by the
formula <code>SYD(500,100,5,1)</code> which returns &pound;133.33.</p>


<h2>TERM</h2>

<p><code>TERM(<span class="csguide-arg">payment</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">interest</span>, <span
class="csguide-arg">fv</span>)</code></p>

<p>Computes the number of periods required for regular payments at a fixed
periodic interest rate to reach a future value (<span
class="csguide-arg">fv</span>).</p>

<p>For example, given that you can invest &pound;5000 a year into a pension fund, at
10% annual interest, how long will it take to accumulate &pound;1,000,000? The
formula <code>TERM(5000,0.10,1000000)</code> returns the answer, 31.94
years.</p>
