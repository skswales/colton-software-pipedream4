<h1>Fonts</h1>

<p>Many printers are able to print your text in a range of different fonts. You
can also see fonts displayed on your screen. A font is the name given to a
design of character.</p>

<p>You can use fonts to make your documents appear much more stylish and
professional. You might want to have your headings printed in one font and your
main text in another or you might want to pick out certain words or phrases by
printing them in a different font to that used for the rest of the text. In
this Reference Guide, for example, the main text, such as this paragraph, is in
a sans-serif font and text which appears on the screen is shown in a monospace
font.</p>

<p>With PipeDream, you can use any outline font which is compatible with RISC
OS. Fonts are displayed on the screen and can be printed out on a suitable
printer using a RISC OS printer driver.</p>

<h2>Setting a Global Font</h2>

<p>The <span class="csguide-command">Font</span> command sets a global font for
the document. Note that you will only be able to print the font if you use a
RISC OS printer driver.</p>

<p>1. Move the pointer over the arrow to the right of <span class="csguide-menu-option">Font</span> in the <span class="csguide-menu">Print</span> menu to see the <span class="csguide-dbox">Font Selector</span> dialogue box.</p>

<p>2. Click Select on the name of the <span class="csguide-option">Font</span>
you require. You may have to use the arrow icons to scroll through the list of
fonts to find the one you want. The weights and styles available for the font
you have chosen will be displayed.</p>

<p>3. Select the <span class="csguide-option">Weight</span> you require by
clicking Select on the weight's name.</p>

<p>4. Select the <span class="csguide-option">Style</span> you require by
clicking Select on the style's name.</p>

<p>5. Click Select on the <span class="csguide-option">Point size</span> you
require. If you want to, you can change either the height or width by setting
it to what you require with the arrow icons.</p>

<p>6. If you want to see what the font will look like, click the <span
class="csguide-dbox-button">Try</span> button. The alphabet will be displayed in the font
you have chosen. You can type in other characters to see what they look like in
your chosen font.</p>

<p>7. Set the <span class="csguide-option">Line height</span> you require.
Font sizes and line height settings are rather subjective but having a Line
height about 120% of the font height usually gives a pleasant effect. By
default, the line height is set to <span class="csguide-option">Auto</span>
which means that PipeDream will give you 120% of the current height setting.
You can change this if you want to do so.</p>

<p>8. Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press
<span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> to select the font.</p>

<p>Note that if you select a very small font, PipeDream will display it on the
screen within PipeDream's minimum screen line height. It will be printed with
the correct line height for the font you have selected.</p>

<h2>Specifying a Change of Font</h2>

<p>The <span class="csguide-command">Local Font</span> command enables you to
specify a local change of font for a cell. At the end of the cell, PipeDream switches
back to the font you have set for the whole document with the <span
class="csguide-command">Font</span> command. Note that you can only have a
local change of font if you have already selected a global font using the <span
class="csguide-command">Font</span> command.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p class="csguide-sample"
style="margin-left:2em;">@F:Corpus.Medium,24,24@Chapter Ten</p>

<p>would print your chapter title in 24 point medium Corpus.</p>

<p>To specify a change of font, proceed as follows:</p>

<p>1. Position the caret at the beginning of the cell you want to change.</p>

<p>2. Bring up the <span class="csguide-menu">Print</span> menu.</p>

<p>3. Move the pointer over the arrow to the right of the <span
class="csguide-menu-option">Local Font</span> option in the <span
class="csguide-menu">Print</span> menu to see the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Local Font</span> dialogue box.</p>

<p>4. Click Select on the name of the <span class="csguide-option">Font</span>
you require.</p>

<p>5. Select the <span class="csguide-option">Weight</span> you require by
clicking Select on its name.</p>

<p>6. Select the <span class="csguide-option">Style</span> you require by
clicking Select on its name.</p>

<p>7. Click Select on the <span class="csguide-option">Point size</span> you
require. If you want to, you can change either the height or width by setting
it to what you require with the arrow icons.</p>

<p>8. If you want to see what the font will look like, click the <span
class="csguide-dbox-button">Try</span> button. The alphabet will be displayed in the font
you have chosen. You can type in other characters to see what they look like in
your chosen font.</p>

<p>9. Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press
<span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> to insert the local font.</p>
