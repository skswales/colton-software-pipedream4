<h1>Error Messages</h1>

<h2>Command Errors</h2>

<h4>Already doing anagrams</h4>

<p>Only one anagram operation can take place at a time.</p>

<h4>Already doing subgrams</h4>

<p>Only one subgram operation can take place at a time.</p>

<h4>Already dumping</h4>

<p>Only one dumping operation can take place at a time.</p>

<h4>Already merging</h4>

<p>Only one merging operation can take place at a time.</p>

<h4>Bad ^ field</h4>

<p>You have specified an incorrect ^ (hat) field in a search string.</p>

<p>If you want to search or replace the ^ character use ^^.</p>

<h4>Bad column</h4>

<p>You have not specified a column on which to sort or the one you have
specified is not within the marked block.</p>

<h4>Bad data transfer, receiver dead</h4>

<p>The data transfer protocol has broken down when transferring between
PipeDream and another resident application.</p>

<h4>Bad dictionary</h4>

<p>The file that PipeDream is trying to open as a dictionary is not a
dictionary file or has become corrupted.</p>

<h4>Bad draw file</h4>

<p>You have specified a file which is not recognisable as a draw format
file.</p>

<h4>Bad language</h4>

<p>You have not supplied a language for PipeDream to use for the alphabet when
opening a dictionary.</p>

<h4>Bad marker</h4>

<p>You have specified an operation which requires a marked block but you do not
have a suitable block marked.</p>

<p>For example, the <span class="csguide-command">Replicate Right</span>
command requires more than one column, <span class="csguide-command">Replicate
Down</span> requires more than one row and <span
class="csguide-command">Sort</span> requires more than one row.</p>

<h4>Bad name</h4>

<p>You have not specified a name for the file to be saved or you have specified
one that the filing system does not like.</p>

<p>Check that you do not have too may characters in a directory or leafname for
the given filing system and that you are not using punctuation characters which
are confusing the filing system.</p>

<h4>Bad option</h4>

<p>1. You have asked to search a marked block and either a column range or all
files in a multi-file document. Both of these combinations of options are
invalid.</p>

<p>2. You have specified that PipeDream should save a marked block and a column
range. This combination of options is invalid.</p>

<p>3. You have specified a microspace pitch of 0. This is not possible.</p>

<h4>Bad parameter</h4>

<p>This is a general message given after supplying incompatible entries in
dialogue boxes. Some examples are:</p>

<p>1. In the <span class="csguide-dbox">Set Column Width</span> dialogue box
you have specified that the widths of all columns should be zero, or that the
width of a fixed column should be zero.</p>

<p>2. In a column range you have specified that the second column is to the
left of the first.</p>

<p>3. There is incorrect command syntax in a key definition or command file. It
is often easiest to check command syntax by performing commands with the
command file recorder switched on and examining the resulting command file.</p>

<p>4. A command file has tried to start another command file. Command files
cannot be nested.</p>

<p>5. PipeDream cannot understand the entries in the fields of a printer
driver.</p>

<h4>Bad range</h4>

<p>1. In a <span class="csguide-command">Replicate</span> command you have
specified two column ranges or two ranges. You need to specify either a column
range and then a row range to copy to, or vice versa. Maybe it would be
possible and easier to use <span class="csguide-command">Replicate Right</span>
or <span class="csguide-command">Replicate Down</span>.</p>

<p>2. The second cell reference in the range is above or to the left of the
first. You must specify ranges as tl-cell br-cell where tl-cell is the top
left-hand cell and br-cell the bottom right-hand cell.</p>

<h4>Bad selection</h4>

<p>You have not specified a valid row selection in the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box.</p>

<p>The row selection should be a conditional formula. See <a
href="fileops.html">File Operations</a>.</p>

<h4>Bad cell</h4>

<p>The cell referred to in a replication command or the <span
class="csguide-command">Go To Cell</span> command does not exist.</p>

<h4>Bad string</h4>

<p>You have specified a search or next match or previous match but not
specified a string to search for.</p>

<h4>Bad word</h4>

<p>You have specified a bad word in a spelling checker dialogue box.</p>

<p>If you are using the English alphabet, words must begin with a letter and
consist of only letters, apostrophes (') and hyphens (-) and may be only 31
characters long.</p>

<h4>Can't close</h4>

<p>PipeDream cannot save the changes that you have made to a dictionary.</p>

<p>The dictionary may have been closed without your explicitly telling
PipeDream, by *SHUT, *BACKUP, *DISMOUNT or *BYE, for example.</p>

<h4>Can't close file</h4>

<p>PipeDream cannot close the file you are saving to disc.</p>

<p>It is probably best to make a backup of the file on another disc immediately
before returning to work out what is wrong on the first disc. It may be that
the disc is full or that it is faulty.</p>

<h4>Can't enlarge dictionary</h4>

<p>You have added some words to a dictionary but there is not enough space on
the disc to save the words.</p>

<p>Either pack the dictionary, delete some files on the disc to make space or
copy the dictionary to a new disc .</p>

<h4>Can't open</h4>

<p>PipeDream cannot open the file or dictionary you have specified.</p>

<p>Check the name carefully. There may be a disc error.</p>

<h4>Can't read dictionary</h4>

<p>PipeDream cannot read the dictionary.</p>

<p>There may be a disc error. Try verifying the disc.</p>

<h4>Can't save a file from PipeDream into itself</h4>

<p>You cannot drag a file icon from the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box back into the
original PipeDream window.</p>

<h4>Can't transfer file (use *Set Wimp$Scrap &lt;filename&gt;)</h4>

<p>RISC OS has not seen !Scrap, or Wimp$Scrap has been *Unset.</p>

<p>Set up a !Scrap on your hard disc or your data disc.</p>

<h4>Can't update dictionary</h4>

<p>PipeDream cannot update the dictionary.</p>

<p>There may be a disc error. Try verifying the disc.</p>

<h4>Can't write to file</h4>

<p>PipeDream is unable to finish writing to the file.</p>

<p>It may be best to save your file onto another disc and then investigate what
is wrong with the first disc. It may be that the disc is full or that it is
faulty.</p>

<h4>Control characters ignored</h4>

<p>PipeDream has encountered control characters when loading the file and has
ignored them.</p>

<p>Check that the file is in the correct format and that it still contains all
necessary information. If not, close the window without saving the file back to
disc.</p>

<h4>Data transfer failed</h4>

<p>The data transfer protocol has broken down when transferring between
PipeDream and another resident application.</p>

<h4>Dictionary read only</h4>

<p>You cannot add words to the master dictionary.</p>

<p>It can only be checked or browsed through for words.</p>

<h4>Driver does not support microspacing</h4>

<p>The current printer driver does not support microspacing.</p>

<p>Have you loaded the correct driver?</p>

<h4>Editing formula</h4>

<p>Some commands are not allowed whilst you are editing a formula.</p>

<p>Press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> to enter the number or the <span
class="csguide-key">Esc</span> key to abandon it and continue.</p>

<p>While you are editing a formula, the menu commands you cannot use are greyed
out.</p>

<h4>Escape</h4>

<p>You have pressed the <span class="csguide-key">Esc</span> key and the activity was abandoned.</p>

<h4>File already exists</h4>

<p>You have asked PipeDream to create or save a file with the name of a file
that already exists.</p>

<h4>File not found</h4>

<p>PipeDream cannot find the specified file.</p>

<p>Check the filename carefully.</p>

<h4>Filing system error</h4>

<p>An error has occurred whilst trying to read from or write to the disc .</p>

<h4>is a directory</h4>

<p>You have tried to drag a directory to the PipeDream icon.</p>

<h4>Line too long</h4>

<p>1. You have tried to join two lines together but the resultant line would be
too long. Lines are restricted to 255 characters.</p>

<p>2. PipeDream cannot replace the old string with the new string because the
line would be too long.</p>

<h4>Lines split</h4>

<p>PipeDream has had to split lines during a save in VIEW format.</p>

<p>This is because VIEW has a limit of 132 characters on its line length.</p>

<h4>Memory full</h4>

<p>All the available memory in the computer has been used up.</p>

<p>Try quitting applications on the icon bar to free some more memory, and
reducing the size of the memory indicators in the task display.</p>

<p>If you have any dictionaries locked into memory, unlock them.</p>

<p>If none of this works, try quitting PipeDream and reloading.</p>

<p>If you still cannot load your file you will have to split it up into smaller
files by loading in ranges of rows and saving the subsets with different
names.</p>

<h4>No driver loaded</h4>

<p>Before setting the microspace option you must load a PipeDream printer
driver.</p>

<h4>No marked block</h4>

<p>You have specified a command which requires a marked block, but there is no
block marked.</p>

<h4>No marked block in this document</h4>

<p>For many block operations, PipeDream insists that the block is in the
current document.</p>

<p>This is to prevent you form accidentally performing the operation on the
wrong file.</p>

<h4>No pages</h4>

<p>You have asked PipeDream to pause between printing each page but the page
length is 0 so there are no pages.</p>

<h4>No RISC OS printer driver</h4>

<p>You have set RISC OS printing in the <span class="csguide-dbox">Printer
Config</span> dialogue box but there is no RISC OS printer driver installed on
the icon bar.</p>

<h4>No selected chart</h4>

<p>You have tried to edit a chart but you do not have one selected.</p>

<h4>Not ASCII file</h4>

<p>The following types of file must be saved in ASCII format:</p>
<ul>
  <li>command files</li>
  <li>mailshot parameters</li>
  <li>printer drivers</li>
</ul>

<h4>Not enough memory or not within Desktop world</h4>

<p>1. You have tried to run PipeDream from outside the desktop.</p>

<p>2. You have altered PipeDream's memory allocation.</p>

<h4>Not enough memory to create window</h4>

<p>You are very close to filling all the memory in the computer.</p>

<h4>Not enough space to create dialogue box</h4>

<p>You are very close to filling all the memory in the computer.</p>

<h4>Oldest position lost</h4>

<p>You already had five caret positions saved and PipeDream has thrown away the
oldest.</p>

<h4>Overlap</h4>

<p>1. In a <span class="csguide-command">Transpose Block</span> command, your
block would overwrite cells containing data.</p>

<p>2. In a <span class="csguide-command">Move Block</span> command, you have
tried to move a block down such that the new top line intersects the old block.
You cannot do this. If you want to move the block down, the new position must
be beneath the bottom row of the original block.</p>

<h4>Protected cell</h4>

<p>You have tried to edit or delete a protected cell.</p>

<p>If you want to remove protection from the whole file, mark it by clicking
select in the mark block box and give the <span class="csguide-command">Clear
Protection</span> command.</p>

<h4>To save, drag the icon to a directory viewer</h4>

<p>You have tried to save a file without specifying which directory to put it
in.</p>

<h4>Too many dictionaries open</h4>

<p>PipeDream can use only five dictionaries at any time.</p>

<h4>Too many windows</h4>

<p>This is a system error informing you that you have too many windows open at
the same time.</p>

<p>Note that menus count as windows.</p>

<h4>Word exists</h4>

<p>You have tried to insert a word into a user dictionary which already exists
within the dictionary.</p>

<h4>word not found</h4>

<p>You are trying to delete a word which is not in the dictionary that you have
specified.</p>
