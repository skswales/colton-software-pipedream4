<h1>File Operations</h1>

<h2>Naming Files</h2>

<p>To name or rename the file in memory, give the <span
class="csguide-command">Rename File</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Files</td>
      <td>Rename file</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">FC</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The name you specify appears on the window's title bar and in the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box when you save the file.</p>

<h2>Saving Files</h2>

<p>You can save an entire document to a named file. Alternatively, you can save
just a range of columns or a marked block. You can also save all rows
satisfying a condition, enabling you to create a subset of a database or a
document. The <span class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box enables
you to specify the format of the file to be saved.</p>

<p>If you have finished editing a file and you want to save it, the simplest
way is to close the window.</p>

<p>If the file has been modified, a prompt will appear asking you whether you
want to save the updated file.</p>

<p>Click on <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Yes</span>. The <span
class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box then appears.</p>

<p>Type in the name with which you want the file to be saved. If you originally
loaded the file from disc or have previously named the file with the <span
class="csguide-command">Rename file</span> command, the filename already
appears at this point.</p>

<p>Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span> to save the file.</p>

<p>Another way to save the file is to drag its icon from the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box into the directory you want to
save it in. Obviously, you need to have the required directory viewer on the
screen. Then drag the file's icon from the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box into the directory viewer. It
will be saved there with the leafname you gave it in the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box.</p>

<h3>To save part of a document</h3>

<p>1. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Save</span> command.</p>

<p>2. When the <span class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box appears, type in the name of the file if necessary and specify the other options as follows:</p>

<p>If you want to save a marked block:</p>

<p>The block you want to save must be marked before you give the <span
class="csguide-command">Save</span> command.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click Select on the <span class="csguide-option">Save only marked
    block</span> option.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to save a selection of rows:</p>

<p>1. Click Select on the <span class="csguide-option">Save selection of
rows</span> option.</p>

<p>2. Type in the condition you want to apply.</p>

<p>The condition you type in will be evaluated before each row is saved. Only
if the result is true will the row be saved. The condition will normally
contain ranges. These are updated one row for each new line.</p>

<p>For example, if you type B1B100&gt;600 as the condition, all rows up to row
100 where the second column evaluates to a number greater than 600 will be
saved.</p>

<p>You can include text strings in the condition, but they must be placed
within double quotation marks.</p>

<p>For example, <code>A1A100&gt;"Fred"</code> will save all rows up to row 100
lying alphabetically after Fred.</p>

<p>A string can contain the wildcards <code>^?</code> (any single character)
and <code>^#</code> (any multiple character). All string comparisons treat
lower- and upper-case letters as matching.</p>

<p>You can save rows which satisfy more than one condition by using the
<code>&amp;</code> (AND) operator and rows which match one of several
conditions by using the <code>|</code> (OR) operator.</p>

<h3>To save a document in different formats</h3>

<p>Click on the format you want. The format of the file you loaded will appear
as the default setting.</p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">PipeDream</span> saves a file in PipeDream
format. This will be the default value for a new file.</p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">CSV</span> saves the file in CSV (comma
separated values) format.</p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">ASCII</span> saves the file in ASCII
format.</p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">VIEW</span> saves the file in VIEW format.</p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">1WP</span> saves the file in First Word Plus
format so that it can be loaded into First Word Plus.</p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">Paragraph</span> saves the file in Paragraph
format for transfer to desktop publishing programs.</p>

<h2>Loading Files</h2>

<p>You can load an entire document into the computer. You can also add to a
document already in memory. You can load part of a document by specifying a
range of row numbers that you want to load; this enables you to load a file in
sections that would be too large to load in one piece. Plain text from another
program can be loaded into PipeDream; fields separated by <code>TAB</code>
characters will automatically be put into separate columns on the document.
PipeDream automatically recognises the format of files and loads them in the
correct format.</p>

<h3>To load a PipeDream document</h3>

<p>The simplest way to load a PipeDream document is to get the directory viewer
containing the file on the screen and double-click Select on the file's
icon.</p>

<h3>To load another file format</h3>

<p>If the file is not a PipeDream file, drag the file's icon from the directory
viewer onto the PipeDream icon on the icon bar.</p>

<h3>Loading a file on start-up</h3>

<p>If you are not already running PipeDream, double-clicking Select on a
PipeDream file's icon will start up PipeDream and load the file.</p>

<h3>To insert one file into another</h3>

<p>Position the caret at the point in one document (file-a) where you want the
other file (file-b) to be inserted. Drag file-b's icon into file-a's window.
The merged file will take file-a's column structure and settings.</p>

<h3>To load part of a document</h3>

<p>1. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Load</span> command. You will see
the <span class="csguide-dbox">Load</span> dialogue box.</p>

<p>2. Type in the name of the file of which you want to load part.</p>

<p>3. Click Select on the <span class="csguide-option">Load only range of
rows</span> option.</p>

<p>4. Type in the first and last rows of the range.</p>

<h3>To load a file in different formats</h3>

<p>Click Select on the required format in the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Load</span> dialogue box.</p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">Auto</span> is the default format. If you do
not change this, PipeDream looks at the start of the file to decide what type
of file it is and loads it assuming that format. It is possible, but very rare,
for PipeDream to make the wrong choice for unusual files. If this happens,
reload the file but this time specify the type explicitly. To do this, bring up
the <span class="csguide-dbox">Load</span> dialogue box from the <span
class="csguide-menu">Files</span> menu. This will have remembered the name of
the file last loaded. Click Select on the desired file format and then click the <span
class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>. When PipeDream has loaded a file in a
particular format, it sets the default format in the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box to match, so that when you
save the file again, it will be replaced in its original format.</p>

<p>If the file was a ViewSheet file, PipeDream will set the file type in the
<span class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box to <span
class="csguide-option">PipeDream</span> because it cannot save ViewSheet
files.</p>
