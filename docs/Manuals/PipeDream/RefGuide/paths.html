<h1>Paths</h1>

<p>There are several types of data file which are used in PipeDream but which
are not normal PipeDream documents. These include dictionaries, command files,
printer drivers, the choices file and the key file. Because you do not tell
PipeDream where these files are by dragging them from a directory viewer to the
PipeDream icon or a window, PipeDream has to know where to look for them. It
needs two pieces of information to do this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the name of the directory containing the file</li>
  <li>the name of the file within the directory (this is known as the
  leafname).</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes PipeDream already knows the leafname. For example, the leafname
of the Choices file is always <em>Choices</em> and the leafname of the master
dictionary is always <em>master</em>. But for other types of file, such as user
dictionaries, you specify the leafname.</p>

<p>PipeDream also needs to know in which directory or directories it should
look for the file. The path, <em>PipeDream$Path</em> or more simply
<em>PipeDream:</em>, tells it where to look. The path can be a single
directory name or, more usually, a list of directories. By default, the path is
a combination of two directories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Choices:PipeDream.</em></li>
  <li><em>&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.Resource.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>where</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><em>Choices:PipeDream</em> is a sub-directory
<em>PipeDream</em> accessible on the <em>Choices:</em> system path and</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><em>&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.Resource</em> is a
sub-directory called <em>Resource</em> in the PipeDream application
directory.</p>

<p>If you want to, you can modify the path to make PipeDream look for the files
in other directories, discs, drives, filing systems or paths.</p>

<p>This can be useful for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to specify a place where PipeDream should always look for command files
    or dictionaries;</li>
  <li>to specify other directories where you wish to store libraries of custom
    functions or data.</li>
</ul>

<p>The path is specified in the file !PipeDream.!Run, which may be found in the
PipeDream application directory.</p>

<p>By default this is set up as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><code>Set PipeDream$Path
Choices:PipeDream.,&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.</code></p>

<p>The Set command is used to set up a system variable called
<code>PipeDream$Path</code> and to set it to
<code>Choices:PipeDream.,&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.Resource.</code> which are to be
the directories PipeDream will look in for its files. Note the dot on the end
of each of the directory names. This is necessary because PipeDream will merely
append the leafname to each of the path elements in turn to create a whole
filename. If you want to change the path, you can edit the !Run file in
Edit.</p>

<p>The following table illustrates where PipeDream looks for each type of file.
'CWD' stands for Current Window Directory and refers to the directory from
which the file in the current window has been loaded. If there is no current
directory, because you have started a new document or renamed a loaded
document, PipeDream will look only on the path.</p>

<p>If files are saved or placed in the sub-directories listed above, they will
be included in the lists of files displayed in dialogue boxes, from which you
can select the file you want. It is therefore recommended that you save each
type of file in the appropriate sub-directory.</p>

<h3>Networks</h3>

<p>PipeDream's paths make it possible to install PipeDream onto a network so
that it looks for main system resources such as the program and master
dictionary in the public area of the file server, but for user resources such
as user dictionaries and template files in the user's own area.</p>
