<h1>Mailshots</h1>

<p>Use PipeDream's mailshot facility if you want to send a personalised version
of a standard letter to every name and address stored in a database or if you
want to print a label for each name and address in your names and addresses
database.</p>

<p>First, you need to prepare a file of names and addresses which will be used
to print your letters.</p>

<p>1. Load your database of names and addresses.</p>

<p>2. Save the database with a different name to the original. This is for
safety. As you are going to make a selection from the records, you do not want
to overwrite your original database. After saving the database, check that
PipeDream has changed the name of the file in the window to the new
filename.</p>

<p>3. Make any selections or deletions required. Your file should look
something like this:</p>

<div class="csguide-sample">

<table border="1">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr class="csguide-border-colhead">
      <th></th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
      <th>C</th>
      <th>D</th>
      <th>E</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="csguide-border-rowhead">1</th>
      <td>Mr Jones</td>
      <td>Managing Director</td>
      <td>Jones &amp; Co</td>
      <td>Garden St</td>
      <td>York</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="csguide-border-rowhead">2</th>
      <td>Mr Byte</td>
      <td>Chief Programmer</td>
      <td>BCPL Ltd</td>
      <td>Lisp Road </td>
      <td>Cambridge</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="csguide-border-rowhead">3</th>
      <td>Mrs Brown</td>
      <td>Secretary</td>
      <td>Girton WI</td>
      <td>Huntingdon Rd</td>
      <td>Oxford</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>4. Save the file of names and addresses in ASCII format with a different
name to the original database. This ASCII format file will be used to produce
the letters.</p>

<p>5. Create the letter template.</p>

<p>If you want to send the following letter to all the people in your names and
addresses database:</p>



<div class="csguide-sample" style="margin-left:2em;width:80%">

<p>Mr. Jones,</p>

<p>Managing Director,</p>

<p>Jones &amp; Co,</p>

<p>Garden St,</p>

<p>York.</p>

<p style="text-align:right;margin-left:auto;margin-right:0;">23.3.2013</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Jones,</p>

<p>I am writing to tell you of the marvellous opportunity</p>

<p>available for Jones &amp; Co. For the whole of May, our</p>

<p>prices will be reduced, so go along to our York branch</p>

<p>and take advantage of the low prices.</p>
</div>



<p>there are various items in the letter which you will want to vary for each
individual to whom the letter is sent.</p>

<p>Type in the letter, replacing each of these items with an @ character,
followed by a number. The number should represent the column in which the item
is found in your names and addresses database.</p>

<p>@0@ is used to represent the first column of the database (i.e. Mr Jones, Mr
Byte, etc.); @1@ represents the second column (i.e. ManagingDirector, Chief
Programmer, etc.) and so on. Be particularly sure to remember that the first
column is represented by @0@, <em>not</em> @1@.</p>



<div class="csguide-sample" style="margin-left:2em;width:80%">

<p>@0,</p>

<p>@1,</p>

<p>@2,</p>

<p>@3,</p>

<p>@4.</p>

<p style="text-align:right;margin-left:auto;margin-right:0;">23.3.2013</p>

<p>Dear @0@@@@@@@,</p>

<p>I am writing to tell you of the marvellous opportunity</p>

<p>available for @2@@@@@@@@@. For the whole of May, our</p>

<p>prices will be reduced, so go along to our @4@@@@@@@@ branch</p>

<p>and take advantage of the low prices.</p>
</div>



<p>As you can see, when an item is used more than once, the same @ number is
used to represent it. Where an item appears within text, put enough @
characters after it for the largest entry of this type in your database. Here,
for example, nine @ characters have been inserted to allow for Cambridge.</p>

<p>6. When you have created the letter template, save it in the same directory
as the ASCII format names and addresses file.</p>

<p>Now that you have prepared your
ASCII format file of names and addresses and your letter template, you can
print out your personalised standard letters:</p>

<p>1. Ensure that the letter template file is loaded.</p>

<p>2. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Printer Config</span> command and
enter the settings appropriate for your printer.</p>

<p>3. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Print</span> command.</p>

<p>4. Click Select on the <span class="csguide-option">Fill from
database</span> option.</p>

<p>5. Type in the name of the ASCII format file containing the names and
addresses database.</p>

<p>6. If you have blank fields in your names and addresses file which you want
to close up when printing, click Select on the <span
class="csguide-option">Omit blank fields</span> option to switch it on. If the
last address item is not in the last column of your database, this may cause
problems.</p>

<p>7. The letter will be printed with different names and addresses replacing
the @ fields in each case. Justification will automatically be adjusted on each
line to suit the actual number of characters in the inserted words.</p>
