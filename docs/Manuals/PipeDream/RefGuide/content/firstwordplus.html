    <h1 id="First">First Word Plus File Transfer</h1>
    <p>
        PipeDream can load and save files in First Word Plus format.
        As with most file conversion between different applications,
        it is not possible to perform a perfect conversion because the two programs have different philosophies and structures.
        However, the converter does ease the task of passing text between the two applications considerably.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Loading">Loading a First Word Plus File</h2>
    <p>
        To load a First Word Plus file, drag the file’s icon from its directory to the PipeDream 4 icon on the icon bar.
        All First Word Plus files have a recognisable header at the beginning, so the PipeDream auto-loader
        should have no trouble determining that the file is a First Word Plus file.
    </p>
    <p>
        PipeDream extracts all the text and most of the highlighting information from the First Word Plus file.
        It should also recover some of the page layout information such as the page length, margins, header and footer.
    </p>
    <p>
        After loading the file, you will probably want to save it in PipeDream format.
        It is best to save the PipeDream document immediately.
        Give the <span class="csg-command">Save as</span> command, change the filename,
        select the <span class="csg-dbox-option">PipeDream</span> format option and then
        click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Save</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).
    </p>

    <h2 id="Saving">Saving a First Word Plus File</h2>
    <p>
        To save a file in First Word Plus format, give the <span class="csg-command">Save as</span> command.
        Check that the filename is what you need.
        You will probably not want to save your First Word Plus file on top of the PipeDream file that you loaded.
        Select the <span class="csg-dbox-option">FWP</span> format option.
        Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Save</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).
        The file will be saved in First Word Plus format.
    </p>
    <p>
        PipeDream saves out all the text and all your highlights.
        It also tries to send out page layout information such as page length, margins, header and footer.
        PipeDream sends column information out separated by Tabs.
        Note that, because First Word Plus cannot store and save Tabs (it converts them to spaces),
        you will not be able to edit the file in First Word Plus, reload it into PipeDream and maintain all the column information.
