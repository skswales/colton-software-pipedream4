    <h1>Paths</h1>
    <p>
        There are several types of data file which are used in PipeDream but which are not normal PipeDream documents.
        These include dictionaries, command files, printer drivers, the Choices file and the key file.
        Because you do not tell PipeDream where these files are by dragging them from a directory display
        to the PipeDream 4 icon or a window, PipeDream has to know where to look for them.
        It needs two pieces of information to do this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the name of the directory containing the file;</li>
        <li>the name of the file within the directory (this is known as the leafname).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Sometimes PipeDream already knows the leafname.
        For example, the leafname of the Choices file is always <span class="csg-filename">Choices</span>
        and the leafname of the master dictionary is always <span class="csg-filename">Master</span>.
        But for other types of file, such as user dictionaries, you specify the leafname.
    </p>
    <p>
        PipeDream also needs to know in which directory or directories it should look for the file.
        The path, <span class="csg-filename">PipeDream$Path</span> (or more simply <span class="csg-filename">PipeDream:</span>), tells it where to look.
        The path can be a single directory name or, more usually, a list of directories.
        By default, the path is a combination of three directories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="csg-filename">Choices:PipeDream.</span><br>this is a sub-directory called
            <span class="csg-filename">PipeDream</span> accessible on the
            <span class="csg-filename">Choices:</span> system path;
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="csg-filename">&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.Resources.UK.</span><br>this is a sub-directory called
            <span class="csg-filename">Resources.UK</span> in the
            PipeDream application directory, containing language-dependent data such as document templates and dictionaries.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="csg-filename">&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.Resources.Neutral.</span><br>this is a sub-directory called
            <span class="csg-filename">Resources.Neutral</span> in the
            PipeDream application directory, containing language-independent data such as chart markers.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to, you can modify the path to make PipeDream look for the files in other directories, discs, drives, filing systems or paths.</p>
    <p>This can be useful for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>to specify a place where PipeDream should always look for command files or dictionaries;</li>
        <li>to specify other directories where you wish to store libraries of custom functions or data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The path is specified in the file <span class="csg-filename">!PipeDream.!Run</span>, which may be found in the PipeDream application directory.</p>
    <p>By default this is set up as follows:</p>
    <pre class="csg-sample-indent">Set PipeDream$Path Choices:PipeDream.,&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.Resources.UK.,&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.Resources.Neutral.</pre>
    <p>
        The Loader is used to create up a system variable called <code>PipeDream$Path</code> and to set it to
        <span class="csg-filename">Choices:PipeDream.,&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.Resources.UK.,&lt;PipeDream$Dir&gt;.Resources.Neutral.</span>
        which are to be the directories PipeDream will look in for its files.
        Note the dot on the end of each of the directory names.
        This is necessary because PipeDream will simply append the leafname to each of the path elements in turn to create a whole filename.
        If you want to change the path, you can edit the <span class="csg-filename">!Run</span> file using !Edit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following table illustrates where PipeDream looks for each type of file.
        CWD stands for Current Window Directory and refers to the directory from which the document in the current window has been loaded.
        If there is no current window directory, because you have started a new document or renamed a loaded document, PipeDream will look only on the path.

        If files are saved or placed in the sub-directories listed above, they will be included in the lists of files displayed in dialogue boxes, from which you can select the file you want.
        It is therefore recommended that you save each type of file in the appropriate sub-directory.

    <p>
        PipeDream’s paths make it possible to install PipeDream onto a network so that it looks for
        main application resources such as the program and master dictionary in the public (possibly read-only) area of a file server,
        but for user resources such as user dictionaries and template files in the user’s own area.
