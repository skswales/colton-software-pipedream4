        If you often need to type the same word or number into a document, you can set it up on a key so that you can enter it with a single key press.
        You can likewise set up a frequently used sequence of commands as a single key press.

        <li>
            2. Click the up / down arrow buttons until the key to which you want to assign the text appears in the right-hand box.
            The number in the left-hand box is the numeric value of the key (in the current character set).
        </li>
        <li>3. Type in the text string you want the key to produce.</li>
        <li>4. Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Define</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you set the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Key to define</span> option to
        <code>121 y</code> and the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Definition</span> option to <code>PipeDream</code>,
        then every time you press the <span class="csg-key">y</span> key
        the word <span class="csg-sample">PipeDream</span> will be inserted into the current document.
    </p>
    <p>To set the <span class="csg-key">y</span> key back to its original function:</p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Give the <span class="csg-command">Define Key</span> command.</li>
        <li>Set the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Key to define</span> option to <code>121 y</code>.</li>
        <li>Leave the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Definition</span> option blank.</li>
        <li>Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Define</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="Command">To Define a Command Sequence</h2>
    <p>A command sequence is defined in exactly the same way, by listing what you would type to issue the commands.</p>
    <p>The differences are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>\</code> is used to represent the <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> key.
            To split a line, for example, you would type <span class="csg-user-text">\ESL|M</span> .
        </li>
        <li>You must type <span class="csg-user-text">|M</span> after each command.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to include the <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span> key in a sequence you should enter it as <span class="csg-user-text">\CEN|M</span> .</p>
    <p>
        For example, if you set the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Definition</span> option to <span class="csg-user-text">PipeDream\CEN|Mby Colton Software</span>,
        when you press the <span class="csg-key">y</span> key now, the following will appear on the screen:
    </p>
    <div class="csg-sample-indent csg-sample">
        <p>PipeDream</p>
        <p>by Colton Software</p>
    </div>
    <p><code>CEN</code> is the Ctrl-key sequence which is generated when the <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span> key is pressed.</p>
    <p>
        You can find the Ctrl-key sequences for other caret movements in the <a href="commands.html">Commands</a> section of this <em>Reference Guide</em>.
        All other sequences appear on the menus, albeit some on long menus only.
    </p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent"><code>\ESL|M\CEN|M</code></p>
    <p>splits the line before doing a carriage return.</p>

    <h2 id="Function">To Redefine a Function Key</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-command">Define Function Key</span> command enables you to redefine the effect of the function keys
        <span class="csg-key">F1</span> to <span class="csg-key">F12</span>, with <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-F<em>n</em></span>,
        <span class="csg-key">Shift-F<em>n</em></span> and
        <span class="csg-key">Shift-Ctrl-F<em>n</em></span> variants.
        So, if you prefer a different function key layout, you can define your own.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a simple example, give the <span class="csg-command">Define Function Key</span> command.
        You will see the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Function key to define</span> option in the dialogue box.
        Use this option to determine which function key you want to redefine.
        Press and hold <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> on the up arrow icon.
        PipeDream displays a list of the function keys
        <span class="csg-list-option">F1</span> to <span class="csg-list-option">F12</span>, then
        <span class="csg-list-option">Shift-F1</span> to <span class="csg-list-option">Shift-F12</span>, then
        <span class="csg-list-option">Ctrl-F1</span> to <span class="csg-list-option">Ctrl-F12</span>, and finally
        <span class="csg-list-option">Shift-Ctrl-F1</span> to <span class="csg-list-option">Shift-Ctrl-F12</span>.
        Release <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> when PipeDream gets to <span class="csg-list-option">Shift-Ctrl-F1</span>.
        If you overshoot, do not worry; simply click on the down arrow icon until you get back to it.
    </p>

    <h4 id="Entering">Entering Strings</h4>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-dbox-option">Definition</span> option is where you specify what you want PipeDream to do when you press <span class="csg-key">Shift-Ctrl-F1</span>.
        Type in:
    </p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent csg-user-text">The cat sat on the mat</p>
    <p>
        and
        click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Define</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Now press <span class="csg-key">Shift-Ctrl-F1</span>.
        You will see that PipeDream enters the text string just as if you had typed it at the keyboard.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Redefctrl">To Redefine a Ctrl-Key Sequence</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-command">Define Command</span> command enables you to redefine the key sequences.
        It is only useful for those of you using foreign language versions of PipeDream.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you want <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-Q</span> to perform an
        <span class="csg-command">Edit Formula</span> command (<span class="csg-cmdseq">Cmd-X</span>), specify:
    </p>
    <p><span class="csg-dbox-option">Command to define</span> <code>Q</code></p>
    <p><span class="csg-dbox-option">Define as</span> <code>X</code></p>
    <p>Now, when you press <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-Q</span>, the <span class="csg-command">Edit Formula</span> command is carried out.</p>
    <p>Think very carefully before redefining the Ctrl-key sequences in this way.</p>
    <p>
        Remember that PipeDream uses the letters F, E, L, P, B, C and S as the first character of multiple key commands
        when Classic menus are selected and so if you redefine any of these, you will be affecting a lot of commands.
        Note that redefining keys in this way does not affect the backslash command sequences in command files or keyboard redefinition.
        Neither do any such redefined sequences appear on menus.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Foreign">Foreign Characters</h2>
    <p>
        As well as using keyboard redefinition to enable you to enter common strings,
        you can also use it to configure your keyboard for foreign character sets,
        although you will probably prefer to use the international keyboard modules.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, redefine the character <code>#</code> to the produce the character <code>&cent;</code>.
        Give the <span class="csg-command">Define Key</span> command.
        On the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Key to define</span> line,
        click the down arrow icon until PipeDream displays <span class="csg-dbox-option-value">35 #</span>.
        Set the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Definition</span> option to
        <code>&cent;</code> by holding down the
        <span class="csg-key">Alt</span> key whilst you type 162 (the value for &cent; in the Latin1 font encoding) on the numeric keypad.
        You should see <span class="csg-dbox-option-value">&cent;</span> appear in the Definition field.
        Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Define</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>) to confirm the definition.
        Now press the <span class="csg-key">#</span> key and PipeDream will enter &cent; in the current cell.
        You may find it convenient to use the <span class="csg-filename">Chars</span> application.
        For the numerical values for particular characters consult your RISC OS <em>User Guide</em>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Commands">Commands</h2>
    <p>As well as redefining keys to produce strings or other characters, you can also redefine keys to perform PipeDream commands.</p>
    <p>
        Imagine that you want to delete every alternate line in a file which is a thousand lines long.
        One way to do this is to move to every alternate line and delete it by pressing and giving the <span class="csg-command">Delete Row</span> command repeatedly.
        But you would probably get rather tired of doing this after a while and start making mistakes, deleting the wrong lines.
        There is a better way.
        Load a file from which you do not mind deleting a few lines.
        Give the <span class="csg-command">Define Function Key</span> command and
        click the up / down arrow buttons until the top line displays <span class="csg-dbox-option-value">Shift-Ctrl-F2</span>.
        Type the following in the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Definition</span> input field:
    </p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent csg-user-text">\Y|M\CCD|M</p>
    <p>
        Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Define</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>) to confirm the definition.
        Move to a paragraph of text and insert a blank line between every line in the paragraph.
        This will probably give you an idea of just how tedious deleting 500 alternate lines would be.
        The definition we entered tells PipeDream to perform a
        <span class="csg-command">Delete Row</span> command (<span class="csg-cmdseq">Cmd-Y</span>) followed by a
        <span class="csg-command">Caret Down</span> command (<span class="csg-cmdseq">Cmd-CCD</span>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Check this by looking at the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu.
        The <a href="commands.html">Commands</a> section of this <em>Reference Guide</em>
        contains a list of all the command sequences which do not appear anywhere on the long menus.
        Now move to the first blank line that you have just inserted.
        Press <span class="csg-key">Shift-Ctrl-F2</span> and you will see the line disappear and the pointer move down.
        Press <span class="csg-key">Shift-Ctrl-F2</span> again and this time hold it down.
        You will see each blank line disappear.
        If you delete some text by mistake, you may be able to recover these lines by defining another function key to insert lines and paste.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Clearing">Clearing Definitions</h2>
    <p>To redefine a key to its original definition, simply define the key with a blank definition string, or one composed entirely of spaces.</p>
