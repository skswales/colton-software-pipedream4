    <h1 id="Mouse">Mouse Techniques</h1>
    <p>The following is a summary of mouse operations which apply to a PipeDream window.</p>

    <h2 id="Positioning">Positioning the Caret</h2>
    <p>
        Moving the pointer onto a row and clicking <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> usually positions the caret in the cell containing the pointer.
        However, if that cell is blank, and there is a text cell to the left which can overlap the blank cell, PipeDream puts the caret in the text cell.
        This is to prevent you from accidentally typing text into two different columns on the same row.
        If you really want the caret to be in the blank cell into which you moved the pointer, hold down <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> and then click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span>.
    </p>
    <p>Alternatively, click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> on the heading of the column and PipeDream will move the caret along the row into that column.</p>

    <h2 id="Loading">Loading Documents</h2>
    <p>
        To load a PipeDream document, either double-click its file icon in a directory display,
        or drag the file’s icon from a directory display (or other running application) onto the PipeDream 4 icon on the icon bar.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Inserting">Inserting Documents</h2>
    <p>Drag a file’s icon from a directory display (or other running application) into a window to insert the file at the caret position.</p>

    <h2 id="Opening">Creating a PipeDream Document</h2>
    <p>To create a new PipeDream document:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the PipeDream 4 icon on the icon bar to bring up the <span class="csg-dbox">New document</span> dialogue box;</li>
        <li>Click the up / down arrows to find the template file you want;</li>
        <li>Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Create</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="Bringing">Bringing up Menus and Choosing Commands</h2>
    <p>With the pointer in a PipeDream document window, click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> to bring up the top level menu.</p>
    <p>To bring up a sub-menu, slide the pointer over the arrow to the right of the menu name.</p>
    <p>
        To choose a command, click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> on the command name.
        This carries out the command and removes the menu from the screen.
        If you click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span>, the menu remains on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>To repeat the last command, use the <span class="csg-command">Repeat Command</span> command:</p>
    <table class="csg-command-table">
        <col>
        <col>
        <col>
        <col>
        <col>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-menu">Menu</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-command">Command</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-tool-none">Tool</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-key">Key</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-cmdseq">Cmd-sequence</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Files</td>
                <td>Repeat command</td>
                <td></td>
                <td><span class="csg-key">F5</span></td>
                <td><span class="csg-cmdseq">J</span></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>This enables you to repeat commands easily without having the menu in the way or having to type long Ctrl-key sequences.</p>

    <h2 id="Putting">Putting Cell References Into the Formula Line</h2>
    <p>
        To put a cell reference into the formula line or formula window whilst you are editing a formula,
        click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> in the cell to which you want to refer.
        The cell can be in the current window or in another window.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, relative cell references will be inserted.
        To fix the row part of the reference, hold down the <span class="csg-key">Shift</span> key when you click in the cell.
        To fix the column part of the reference, hold down the <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> key when you click in the cell.
        PipeDream will add $ signs to fix the reference.
    </p>
    <p>
        To insert a range in the formula line or formula window you can either click
        <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> at the start and the end of the range,
        or you can drag from the start to the end of the range.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Using">Using Scroll Bars</h2>
    <p>
        To scroll one line in the direction of the arrow, position the pointer on the scroll arrow and click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span>.
        Hold down <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> to continue scrolling.
        Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> to scroll back the other way.
        The caret always remains within the PipeDream document window, staying as near as possible to its original position.
    </p>
    <p>
        To scroll windowful by windowful, position the pointer on the darker part of
        the scroll bar (above the slider to scroll up, below the slider to scroll down)
        and click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span>. The next windowful of the document will appear.
        Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> to scroll back the other way.
        The caret always remains within the PipeDream window, moving, if necessary to the point nearest to its position before scrolling.
    </p>
    <p>
        To move down through the document, position the pointer on the slider, press <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> and hold it down.
        Drag the slider to display the part of the document you want to see.
    </p>
    <p>
        To move from one side of a document to the other, use the horizontal scroll bars.
        The caret always remains within the PipeDream document window, staying as near as possible to its original position.
    </p>
