    <h1 id="Spell">Spell - Checking</h1>
    <p>The Spell commands are used to help you check that your documents are correctly spelt.</p>
    <p>
        You can check spelling as you type; if you type a word which isn&rsquo;t in PipeDream&rsquo;s dictionary,
        the computer bleeps to let you know that you might have made a mistake.
        This is called &lsquo;auto-checking&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>If you prefer, you can check the whole document when you have finished typing, and point out possible errors all in one go.</p>
    <p>
        When you find a mistake, or you want to check the spelling of a word of which you are unsure,
        you can browse through PipeDream&rsquo;s master dictionary to find the word for which you are looking.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Auto">Switching On Auto Check</h2>
    <p>Take the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> on the PipeDream icon on the icon bar to bring up the <span class="csg-menu">Icon</span> menu.</li>
        <li>Display the <span class="csg-menu">Choices</span> sub-menu.</li>
        <li>
            Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> on the <span class="csg-menu-option">Auto check</span> option.
            A tick will appear next to the option name, to show that it has been selected.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Now type the following sentence.
        Be careful to include the deliberate mistakes!
    </p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent csg-sample">
        The quick brown fox jimps
        over the lzay dug.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will notice that the computer bleeps when you type jimps and lzay.
        Notice also that it does not bleep when you type dug.
        Of course, this is because &lsquo;dug&rsquo; is a valid word in the PipeDream dictionary.
        This illustrates that spelling checkers alone can only check whether a word is valid in isolation, not whether the word is correct in context.
        However, you will find that most typing and spelling errors do not result in another real word, so the spelling checker will still prove invaluable!
    </p>
    <p>
        When the computer bleeps, you should examine the word you have just typed and decide why it bleeped.
        Remember that PipeDream&rsquo;s rule is very simple: if the word is in the dictionary there will be no bleep; if the word is not in the dictionary, the computer will bleep.
    </p>
    <p>
        The majority of words that you use will already be in PipeDream&rsquo;s dictionary,
        but if you type scientific or technical documents then you are more likely to encounter words which PipeDream does not know about.
    </p>
    <p>Other types of word not in the dictionary are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>acronyms like &lsquo;NATO&rsquo;, &lsquo;RSPB&rsquo; and &lsquo;USM&rsquo;;</li>
        <li>abbreviations like &lsquo;Dr.&rsquo;, &lsquo;Rd.&rsquo; and &lsquo;PhD&rsquo;;</li>
        <li>proper nouns like &lsquo;Madeleine&rsquo;, &lsquo;Provence&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tabitha&rsquo;.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you decide that you would like PipeDream to accept some of these, or any others, as valid words, then you can add them to a user dictionary.
        User dictionaries are described in the next section.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have decided why the computer bleeped when you typed the word, you will know whether to correct the word, to add it to a dictionary or to leave it.
        To correct the word, use the usual PipeDream editing functions.
        When you have finished changing the word and you move the caret away, PipeDream will check the word again.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Browsing">Browsing</h2>
    <p>
        You may be unsure of the spelling of a word when the computer bleeps.
        PipeDream allows you to look quickly through the dictionary so you can find the word you want.
        After the computer bleeps, give the <span class="csg-command">Browse</span> command:
    </p>
    <table class="csg-command-table">
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-menu">Menu</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-command">Command</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-tool">Tool</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-key-none">Key</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-cmdseq">Cmd-sequence</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Spell</td>
                <td>Browse</td>
                <td><span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> <img src="images/toolbar/spell_check.png" alt="Spelling icon" style="vertical-align: bottom;" /></td>
                <td></td>
                <td><span class="csg-cmdseq">SB</span></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        The word which was at the caret when you gave the command will be in the dialogue box which appears.
        Press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>, and the <span class="csg-dbox">Browse</span> window will appear,
        filled with words alphabetically near to the word in the dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you can move about the dictionary using the mouse.
        Notice also the caret in the small input field at the top of the window.
        Using the left and right arrow keys and the Backspace key, and also by typing, you can edit the word in this small input field.
        The dictionary display in the larger window below will immediately jump to a new position as you change the word.
    </p>
    <p>By using this feature, you will find that you can move quickly about the dictionary to search for words.</p>
    <p>
        To leave the Browse window and return to the text, press <span class="csg-key">Escape</span>.
        If you click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">OK</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>)
        to leave the Browse window, the word shown in the small input field at the top of the Browse window
        will be inserted into the text at the caret position and will replace the original word.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Advanced">Advanced browsing</h3>
    <p>
        When you give the <span class="csg-command">Browse</span> command,
        PipeDream puts the word at the caret into the <span class="csg-dbox">Browse</span> dialogue box for your convenience.
        You can edit the word which is shown, or substitute your own word to position the Browse window wherever in the dictionary you would like.
        If there is no word at the caret, PipeDream leaves the dialogue box blank, and you can enter your own word.
    </p>
    <p>
        Browse also has a &lsquo;wildcard&rsquo; facility which enables you to search the dictionary for a particular set of words.
        Say you wanted to look at all the words beginning with the letter &lsquo;a&rsquo;, all the words ending in &lsquo;-ism&rsquo;
        or all the words beginning in &lsquo;s&rsquo;, ending in &lsquo;e&rsquo; and with six letters.
        These are all things you can do with Browse, using wildcards.
    </p>
    <p>&lsquo;Wildcard&rsquo; is a name for a set of symbols which you can put into a word which will allow one or more different letters to appear at that position in the word.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>^#&nbsp;</code>matches any number of any letters;</li>
        <li><code>^?&nbsp;</code>matches any one letter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you type a word containing one or more of these symbols into the Browse dialogue box,
        PipeDream will search the dictionary for all the words that fit the pattern that you have given.
        Any words which fit the pattern will appear in the Browse window after you
        click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">OK</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).
    </p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent"><code>a^#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>will match all words starting with &lsquo;a&rsquo;.</p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent"><code>^#e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>will match all words ending with &lsquo;e&rsquo;.</p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent"><code>s^?^?^?^?e&nbsp;</code>will match all six letter words beginning with &lsquo;s&rsquo; and ending with &lsquo;e&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>You will notice two things when you browse with wildcards:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The fewer words that fit the pattern that you give to PipeDream, the longer PipeDream will take to find words that match.</li>
        <li>You cannot edit the wildcard string, as you can edit a normal word, once you are in the Browse window.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can press <span class="csg-key">Escape</span> to interrupt the search if it is taking too long.</p>

    <h2 id="Checking">Checking a Whole Document</h2>
    <p>
        Some people dislike automatic checking.
        You may not wish to have your creative impulse diverted by worrying about spelling
        or you may wish to check a document which already exists
        or which has come from a computer or word processor which does not have a spelling checker.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this case you can leave automatic checking switched off and use PipeDream to check the whole document in one go.
        First, the document must be loaded into PipeDream.
        Then, give the <span class="csg-command">Check Document</span> command:
    </p>
    <table class="csg-command-table">
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-menu">Menu</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-command">Command</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-tool">Tool</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-key-none">Key</th>
                <th class="csg-ct-th-cmdseq">Cmd-sequence</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Spell</td>
                <td>Check document</td>
                <td><img src="images/toolbar/spell_check.png" alt="Spelling icon" /></td>
                <td></td>
                <td><span class="csg-cmdseq">SC</span></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        You will see the <span class="csg-dbox">Check Document</span> dialogue box.
        If you have a block marked which you wish to check, select on the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Check marked block</span> option.
        Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Check</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>)
        when you are ready to start checking the document.
        PipeDream starts at the top of the document and checking proceeds word by word through the document until it encounters a word which is not in the dictionary.
        Then the <span class="csg-dbox">Checking</span> dialogue box will appear.
        The top line of the document&rsquo;s window has the unrecognised word on it, which also appears in the <span class="csg-dbox">Checking</span> dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>Now you must decide what you want to do:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accept the word as it is:</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent">
        Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">OK</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).
        Once you have accepted a word as it is, PipeDream will remember the word,
        and you won&rsquo;t be asked about further occurrences of the word until you leave and restart PipeDream.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change the word:</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent">
        Edit the word and click the <span class="csg-dbox-button">Change word</span> button.
        The word in the document will be changed.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Browse through the dictionary:</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent">
        Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> on the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Browse</span> option.
        The Browse window will appear, positioned at the word in the dialogue box, and then you may browse through the dictionary.
    </p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent">
        When you finish browsing, you will switch back to the <span class="csg-dbox">Checking</span> dialogue box.
        If you press <span class="csg-key">Escape</span> to leave the Browse window, the word in the dialogue box will be left unaltered; if you
        click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">OK</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>),
        the current word in the Browse window will replace the original word in the <span class="csg-dbox">Checking</span> dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent">Once you are back in the <span class="csg-dbox">Checking</span> dialogue box, you may choose again any of the options available in it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the word to the user dictionary:</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent">
        Turn on the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Add word to user dictionary</span> option and type in the name of the user dictionary to which you want to add the word.
        The word shown in the <span class="csg-dbox">Checking</span> dialogue box will be added to the user dictionary indicated.
        You can select a different user dictionary, if you wish, by editing the user dictionary name in the usual way.
    </p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent">
        When you are ready to add the word,
        click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">OK</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).
    </p>
    <p>You can stop checking the document, before PipeDream has finished, by pressing <span class="csg-key">Escape</span> when the <span class="csg-dbox">Checking</span> dialogue box appears.</p>
    <p>
        When the whole document has been checked, an information box will appear showing how many words were not recognised, and how many words were added to user dictionaries.
        Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Close</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>)
        to return to the document; PipeDream will replace the caret at the position in the document where you were before starting the document check.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Dictionary">Dictionary Locking</h2>
    <p>If you are using removable media, such as a floppy disc, with PipeDream on your computer, there are two different ways that you can choose to operate PipeDream:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lock the main dictionary into memory:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This frees the disc drive for a data disc containing user dictionaries or documents to be checked.
        It also results in faster operation.
        However, it uses up a large slice of memory (about 240KB for the master dictionary) which may not be desirable if you are short of memory.
    </p>
    <p>In order to lock the dictionary, place the media containing the dictionary into the computer and give the <span class="csg-command">Lock Dictionary</span> command:</p>
    <table class="csg-command-table">

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p id="Unlock">
        You can also lock user dictionaries if you wish.
        PipeDream will load the dictionary from the disc and it will remain in memory until you unlock it by giving the <span class="csg-command">Unlock Dictionary</span> command, or until you leave PipeDream:

    </table>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep the dictionary disc in the disc drive whilst you are checking or typing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If the dictionary is not locked, you can change disks to load or save files,
        but the dictionary disc must be in the disc drive when PipeDream needs to check a word.
        If it is not, you will be prompted to insert the dictionary disc as necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        PipeDream will automatically keep as much of the dictionary as it can in the free memory of the machine,
        and will only access the dictionary disc when it needs to.
        If the dictionary is locked, the whole dictionary will remain in memory until you unlock it.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Anagrams">Anagrams</h2>
    <p>PipeDream has an anagram command which enables you to find quickly the possible anagrams of a collection of letters or a word.</p>
    <p>To find an anagram, give the <span class="csg-command">Anagrams</span> command:</p>
    <table class="csg-command-table">

        Specify a user dictionary if you like&mdash;normally you will search the main dictionary since this contains many more possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are ready,
        click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">OK</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>)
        and PipeDream will begin searching for anagrams.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Anagram window will display the anagrams as it finds them.
        If no anagrams have been found, this window will be blank.
    </p>
    <p>Some examples of words with anagrams are:</p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent">star, spear, Easter, conversation.</p>
    <p>
        If you give a very long word or large number of letters, it may take PipeDream some time to find the anagrams.
        You can always stop the anagram search by clicking on the <span class="csg-dbox-button">Stop</span> or <span class="csg-dbox-button">Pause</span> buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are ready to return to the text
        click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">OK</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>).
    </p>

    <h2 id="Subgrams">Subgrams</h2>
    <p>Subgrams are words which can be made from the some or all of the letters of a specified word.</p>
    <p>For example, some subgrams of &lsquo;dream&rsquo; are &lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;me&rsquo;, &lsquo;ear&rsquo;, &lsquo;read&rsquo; and &lsquo;armed&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>To find the subgrams of a word, give the <span class="csg-command">Subgrams</span> command:</p>
    <table class="csg-command-table">
        <col />
        <col />

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>When the dialogue box appears, type in the word whose subgrams you want to find.</p>
    <p>
        Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">OK</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>)
        to see a window listing the word&rsquo;s subgrams.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Saving">Saving your Spell Checking Set-up</h2>
    <p>
        You can instruct PipeDream to remember whether automatic checking is switched on or off by saving a Choices file.
        When you restart PipeDream, the automatic checking status which you were using will be set.
