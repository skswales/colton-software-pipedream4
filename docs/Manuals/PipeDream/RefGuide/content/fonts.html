    <h1>Fonts</h1>
    <p>
        Many printers are able to print your text in a range of different fonts.
        You can also see fonts displayed on your screen.
        A font is the name given to a design of character (typeface) presented at a given weight, style and size.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use fonts to make your documents appear much more stylish and professional.
        You might want to have your headings printed in one font and your main text in another or
        you might want to pick out certain words or phrases by printing them in a different font to that used for the rest of the text.
        In this <em>Reference Guide</em>, for example, the main text, such as this paragraph,
        is in a sans-serif typeface and text which appears on the screen is shown in a monospace typeface.
    </p>
    <p>
        With PipeDream, you can use any outline font which is compatible with RISC OS.
        Fonts are displayed on the screen and can be printed out on a suitable printer using a RISC OS printer driver.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Setting">Setting a Global Font</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-command">Font</span> command sets a global font for the document.
        Note that you will only be able to print the font if you use a RISC OS printer driver.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Move the pointer over the arrow to the right of <span class="csg-menu-option">Font</span> in the
            <span class="csg-menu">Print</span> menu to see the <span class="csg-dbox">Font Selector</span> dialogue box.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the name of the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Font</span> you require.
            You may have to use the up / down arrow buttons to scroll through the list of fonts to find the one you want.
            The weights and styles available for the font you have chosen will be displayed.
        </li>
        <li>Select the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Weight</span> you require by clicking on its name.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Style</span> you require by clicking on its name.</li>
        <li>
            Select the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Point size</span> you require by clicking it.
            If you want to, you can change either the height or width by setting it to what you require with the up / down arrow buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you want to see what the font will look like, click the <span class="csg-dbox-button">Try</span> button.
            The alphabet will be displayed in the font you have chosen.
            You can type in other characters to see what they look like in your chosen font.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Line height</span> you require.
            Font sizes and line height settings are rather subjective but having a Line height about 120% of the font height usually gives a pleasant effect.
            By default, the line height is set to <span class="csg-dbox-option">Auto</span> which means that PipeDream will give you 120% of the current height setting.
            You can change this if you want to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
            To select this font,
            click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Set</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>)
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Note that if you select a very small font, PipeDream will display it on the screen within PipeDream&rsquo;s minimum screen line height.
        It will be printed with the correct line height for the font you have selected.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Specifying">Specifying a Change of Font</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-command">Local Font</span> command enables you to specify a local change of font for a cell.
        At the end of the cell, PipeDream switches back to the font you have set for the whole document with the <span class="csg-command">Font</span> command.
        Note that you can only have a local change of font if you have already selected a global font using the <span class="csg-command">Font</span> command.
    </p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent csg-sample">@F:Corpus.Medium,24,24@Chapter Ten</p>
    <p>would print your chapter title in 24 point Corpus.Medium.</p>
    <p>To specify a change of font, proceed as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Position the caret at the beginning of the cell you want to change.</li>
        <li>Bring up the <span class="csg-menu">Print</span> menu.</li>
        <li>
            Move the pointer over the arrow to the right of the <span class="csg-menu-option">Local Font</span> option in the
            <span class="csg-menu">Print</span> menu to see the <span class="csg-dbox">Local Font</span> dialogue box.
        </li>
        <li>Click the name of the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Font</span> you require.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Weight</span> you require by clicking on its name.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Style</span> you require by clicking on its name.</li>
        <li>
            Select the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Point size</span> you require by clicking on it.
            If you want to, you can change either the height or width by setting it to what you require with the up / down arrow buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you want to see what the font will look like, click the <span class="csg-dbox-button">Try</span> button.
            The alphabet will be displayed in the font you have chosen.
            You can type in other characters to see what they look like in your chosen font.
        </li>
        <li>
            To insert the local font change,
            click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Insert</span></span> button (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>)
