    <h1>Pictures</h1>
    <p>
        Pictures created in RISC OS Draw or Paint programs and stored as Draw files on your computer can be inserted into a PipeDream document.
        Where it is available, PipeDream also now uses <code>!ChangeFSI</code> to allow many more image file types to be imported.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Move the caret to the bottom of the paragraph below which you want the picture to appear.</li>
        <li>
            Give the <span class="csg-command">Insert Row</span> command repeatedly to insert sufficient space for your picture.
            It is very important that you leave plenty of space for your picture as, when you insert it,
            it will be displayed over anything below or to the right of the space you have allowed for it, if that space is not big enough.
            It is better to leave too much space than not to have enough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ensure that the caret is in the cell at the top-left of where you want the picture positioned.
            Bring onto the screen the directory display containing the picture file.
            Drag the picture’s file icon into the PipeDream document window.
            PipeDream will load the picture and position it at the caret.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>PipeDream does not in fact store the picture file within the PipeDream document but simply inserts a reference to it in the form:</p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent"><code>@G:filename,100@</code></p>
    <p>Because of this, you need only one copy of the picture on the disc, not one for each document.</p>
    <p>
        The number at the end indicates the percentage scale factor at which the picture is to be drawn.
        You can change this to other values to resize the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is best to drag the picture to the document from the same directory as the document was loaded.
        If you do this, PipeDream stores just the leafname (and not the whole directory path) of the picture.
        If the directories are different, PipeDream has to store the whole directory path.
        Storing just the leafname is advantageous because the two files can be copied into other directories or onto other discs
        and PipeDream will look for the file in the new directory rather than the original one.
    </p>
    <p>Alternatively, proceed as follows:</p>
    <!-- ol start="4" -->
    <ul class="csg-netsurf-2434">
        <li>
            4. Type in <span class="csg-key">@G:<em>filename</em>@</span> where <em>filename</em> is the name of the file
            containing a picture you have created in a draw or paint program and want to insert at this point.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By default, PipeDream looks for the picture file in the same directory as the file you are editing.
        It is, therefore, a good idea to keep pictures and text for the same document in the same directory.
    </p>
    <!-- ol start="5" -->
    <ul class="csg-netsurf-2434">
        <li>5. Press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span> and you will see that the picture has been inserted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If necessary, delete any blank rows between the picture and the paragraph beneath it by positioning the caret
        on the blank row immediately below the picture and giving the <span class="csg-command">Delete Row</span> command.
    </p>
    <p>Note that when the cell containing the picture is not on the screen, no part of the picture is shown.</p>
