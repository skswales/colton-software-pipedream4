    <h1>HotLinks</h1>
    <p>
        PipeDream HotLinks enable PipeDream and other applications to share data dynamically.
        For example, you can create a spreadsheet in PipeDream, link PipeDream to a spreadsheet charts program;
        the charts program can then draw a chart based on the PipeDream spreadsheet and update it dynamically.
        You can, of course, use PipeDream to create charts for you dynamically.
        However, you may want to use another charts program to create the particular type of chart
        which interests you and which PipeDream does not support.
    </p>
    <p>
        The way in which you use HotLinks depends on the other application, but is usually very simple.
        Using HotLinks Presenter, for example,you would:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create your spreadsheet in PipeDream.</li>
        <li>Install HotLinks Presenter on the icon bar.</li>
        <li>In PipeDream, mark the part of the spreadsheet from which you want to produce a chart.</li>
        <li>
            Choose the New Link option in Presenter&rsquo;s icon menu.
            This establishes the link between the two programs and passes the initial data from PipeDream to Presenter.
        </li>
        <li>In HotLinks Presenter, create the chart you require.</li>
        <li>
            In PipeDream, edit the data until you are happy with it.
            Any changes you make to the data in PipeDream are automatically reflected in Presenter&rsquo;s chart.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Another HotLinks package is HotLinks GraphBox from Minerva.
        For details of HotLinks Presenter, HotLinks GraphBox and other HotLinks packages, contact Lingenuity and Minerva directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        HotLinks extend PipeDream&rsquo;s scope by enabling you to share data with other software.
        However, you will probably find it easier to create charts from your spreadsheets inside PipeDream.
        Of course, PipeDream&rsquo;s own charts are HotLinked.
        Also, if you create and edit the charts purely within PipeDream, you have more facilities to help you
        incorporate the chart within your document and ensure that the chart automatically restarts when you reload the document.
        As in other areas, it is usually easier to edit your data within PipeDream rather than with two separate editors.
