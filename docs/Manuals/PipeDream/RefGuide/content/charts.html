    <h1>Charts</h1>
    <p>
        PipeDream enables you to produce many types of chart from your spreadsheets;
        you can produce pie charts, bar charts, line charts, scatter charts and overlay charts.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each type of chart, you can choose from a wide variety of styles by selecting the style you want from a gallery,
        in which you can see examples of the possible styles for the chart type you have chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have produced a chart, you can resize it and edit each part of it individually.
        You also have a great deal of control over the final appearance of your chart in terms of colour, text style and fill style.
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, PipeDream provides all the facilities you need to produce exactly the chart you want.</p>
    <p>The charts you produce are dynamic, i.e. any changes made to the spreadsheet data on which they are based are reflected in the charts themselves.</p>

    <p>
        The chart editing window is displayed, containing the chart produced from the marked block of spreadsheet data.
        The chart type used is the preferred chart type.
        If you have not yet set a preferred chart type, PipeDream displays a bar chart.
        The chart displayed in the chart editing window becomes the current chart,
        i.e. any chart commands you give will be applied only to this chart.
    </p>
    <p>
        If there are more rows than columns or an equal number of rows and columns in the marked block,
        PipeDream assumes that the categories (i.e. the x-data) run across the columns.
        If any of the cells in the leftmost column of the marked block are text cells,
        PipeDream assumes that the column contains the category labels.
        If any of the cells in the top row of the marked block are text cells,
        PipeDream assumes that the row contains the series labels&mdash;normally these are only seen in legends or 3-D charts.
    </p>
    <p>
        If there are more columns than rows in the marked block,
        PipeDream assumes that the categories (i.e. the x-data) run down the rows from the top of the marked block.
        If any of the cells in the top row of the marked block are text cells,
        PipeDream assumes that the row contains the category labels.
        If any of the cells in the leftmost column of the marked block are text cells,
        PipeDream assumes that the column contains the series labels&mdash;normally these are only seen in legends or 3-D charts.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Alterchart">Altering a Chart by Altering Data in PipeDream</h2>
    <p>If you make a change to any PipeDream cell in the block from which a chart was produced, the chart is reformatted and redisplayed, taking account of the change you have made.</p>
    <p>
        If you insert rows or columns into the block from which a chart was produced, new entries are made in the chart.
        If you delete rows or columns from the block, the corresponding entries are removed from the chart.
    </p>
    <p>Note that the same block can be used to produce more than one chart.</p>

    <h2 id="Selecting">Selecting a Chart</h2>
    <p>
        You can select a chart.
        This makes it the current chart, so that any commands you give will operate upon it.

    <p>
        If one of the charts is within a PipeDream document, the leafname of the document is shown in brackets.
        For example, <code>[Penguins]BarChart1</code> represents a chart called &lsquo;BarChart1&rsquo; within the document &lsquo;Penguins&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>If a chart appears in more than one PipeDream document, a number is displayed next to the chart&rsquo;s name to indicate how many documents contain it.</p>

        <li>
            If you want to restore the preferred chart type, click the <span class="csg-menu-option">Preferred</span> option.
            If you want to set a different chart type, slide off the appropriate option.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Unless you clicked on <span class="csg-menu-option">Preferred</span>, the <span class="csg-dbox">Gallery</span> dialogue box for the chart type you chose is displayed.</p>

    <h3 id="Pie">Pie</h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-dbox">Pie Gallery</span> dialogue box displays pictures of eight styles of pie chart.
        Choose the style closest to the final result you want by clicking on the appropriate picture.
    </p>
    <p>The remaining options in the dialogue box enable you to fine-tune your pie chart so that you get exactly what you want.</p>
    <p>
        You can specify that all sectors, or a selected sector, of the pie chart should be exploded by a given distance or brought back to the centre.
        Use the <span class="csg-dbox-option">All</span> and <span class="csg-dbox-option">Selection</span> radio buttons
        and the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Distance</span> input field to make these settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can choose whether the pie chart should run clockwise or anti-clockwise and specify the starting angle.
        Either click the radio buttons to select a 12, 3, 6 or 9 o&rsquo;clock starting angle, type in a number or use the up / down arrow buttons to set the angle you require.
        Note that the number specifies a clockwise bearing in the same way as a compass, i.e. 0 at the top, 90 at the middle right, etc.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Bar">Bar</h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-dbox">Bar Gallery</span> dialogue box displays pictures of the available styles of bar chart.
        Choose the style closest to the final result you want by clicking on the appropriate picture.
    </p>
    <p>The remaining dialogue box options enable you to set the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the percentage overlap between adjacent bar slots in a category</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This can be positive to space the bar slots out, zero to have the bar slots abutting each other or negative to have the bar slots overlapping.
        A setting of 100% would make the bar slots overlap completely.
        This setting does not apply to 3-D bar charts.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the percentage width of bars in their slots</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A setting of zero would make the bars very thin; a setting of 100% would make them fill their slots.
        This setting also applies to 3-D bar charts.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the percentage depth of bars in their slots</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A setting of zero would make the bars very thin; a setting of 100% would make them fill their slots.
        This setting applies only to 3-D bar charts.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a fill style (see below) using a picture has been chosen,
        you can specify whether the picture is stretched vertically to fill the bar
        or whether the number of copies of the picture used to fill the bar is dependent on the bar value.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>3-D</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Click on the 3-D option icon to turn 3-D on or off.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you select 3-D, you can change two further parameters that control the view.
            The chart can be turned about a vertical axis and the front of the chart can be drooped forwards.
            Either use the up / down arrow buttons to set these values or type in the number of degrees.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="Line">Line</h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-dbox">Line Gallery</span> dialogue box displays pictures of the available styles of line and point chart.
        Point charts are line charts without the lines between points.
        Choose the style closest to the final result you want by clicking on the appropriate picture.
    </p>
    <p>The remaining dialogue box options enable you to set the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In 3-D, the percentage depth of lines in their slots</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This gives a ribbon which can be filled in a solid colour.
        The line style and line colour settings only affect the lines bounding the ribbon.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>droplines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If this option is set, lines are dropped from each data point to the category axis.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Scatter">Scatter</h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-dbox">Scatter Gallery</span> dialogue box displays pictures of the available styles of scatter chart.
        Choose the style closest to the final result you want by clicking on the appropriate picture.
    </p>
    <p>
        In scatter charts, points are plotted at x and y positions corresponding to their numeric input pair, rather than using labelled categories.
        The points may be joined by lines in the style you select (see below).
        Note that the x-data is not sorted by PipeDream.
        Hence if the input x-data is not sorted, the lines joining the points may go backwards from right to left as well as from left to right.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the dialogue box you can select the x-error bar and y-error bar independently.
        These take additional values and are used to draw error bars of the given length in the x and/or y directions.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Overlays">Overlays</h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-dbox">Overlays Gallery</span> dialogue box displays pictures of the available styles of overlay chart.
        Choose the style closest to the final result you want by clicking on the appropriate picture.
    </p>
    <p>
        The series in the chart are repartitioned such that not more than half of them are moved to the overlay chart.
        Overlays have chart type, axes and scaling independent of the main chart.
        Pie charts cannot be overlaid or used as overlays.
    </p>
    <p>
        To remove the overlay from a chart, use the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Remove overlay</span> button
        in the <span class="csg-dbox">Line Gallery</span>, <span class="csg-dbox">Bar Gallery</span> or <span class="csg-dbox">Scatter Gallery</span> dialogue boxes.
        All series will then be put back into the main chart.

    <p>Selecting any kind of pie will force overlays to be removed.</p>

    <h2 id="Changing">Changing the style of your chart</h2>
    <p>You can change the style of any part of your chart:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click Select on the part of the chart you want to change.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can select the chart background, plot area, individual axes, series, etc.</p>
    <p>Series are numbered from 1, so series 1 is called S1.</p>
    <p>
        Points within a series can be selected individually by clicking Adjust on them.
        S2P4 refers to point 4 in series 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        Axes are numbered from 1 to 6.
        The numbering depends on whether 3-D is set and whether there are any overlays:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Axis 1 is always the main category x-axis.</li>
        <li>Axis 2 is always the main value y-axis.</li>
        <li>Axis 3 is the main series z-axis if 3-D is set or, if not, an overlay category axis.</li>
        <li>Axis 4 is an overlay category axis if 3-D is set or, if not, an overlay value axis.</li>
        <li>Axis 5 is an overlay value axis.</li>
        <li>Axis 6 is an overlay series axis.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Slide off the <span class="csg-menu-option">Selection</span> option to bring up the <span class="csg-menu">Selection</span> sub-menu.</li>
        <li>Slide off the <span class="csg-menu-option">Axis</span> option.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You will see the <span class="csg-dbox">Axis</span> dialogue box in
        which you can set the axis control attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can specify the position of the axis, to the left or right of the plot
        area or as close to zero as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can turn log (base 10) scaling of an axis on or off for a selected axis.
        Note that log scaling turns off all other axis scaling and interval options.
    </p>
    <p>You can turn autoscaling on or off for a selected axis.</p>
    <p>
        If autoscaling is turned off, the chart uses the specified minimum and
        maximum values on that axis. If the actual data values fall outside this range,
        the range used to plot the graph is increased accordingly to ensure that all
        your data is plotted sensibly.
    </p>
    <p>You can turn grid lines on or off for an axis.</p>
    <p>You can turn major and minor ticks on or off for an axis.</p>
    <p>
        You can specify whether these ticks are to the left (or bottom), right (or
        top) or centred on the axis.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can specify the major and minor tick intervals which are used if the
        autointerval option is turned off. Note that if major ticks are turned off
        minor ticks are also turned off.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you have made the settings you require,
        click the <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Saving">Saving Your Chart</h2>
    <p>You can save your chart, either as a &lsquo;live&rsquo; dynamic chart or as a &lsquo;dead&rsquo; Draw file, into a PipeDream document.</p>
    <p>To save a dynamic chart into a PipeDream document:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the window of the PipeDream document into which you want to insert the chart.</li>
        <li>Position the caret at the top left of where you want the chart positioned.</li>
        <li>Give the <span class="csg-command">Save</span> command from the <span class="csg-menu">Chart Editing</span> menu.</li>
        <li>Slide off the Chart option.</li>
        <li>Drag the chart&rsquo;s file icon into the PipeDream document window.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This inserts an <a id="atG"><code>@G</code></a> reference to the chart file.</p>
    <p>
        Whenever the chart is updated, those PipeDream document windows which contain it are redrawn.
        You can adjust the <code>@G</code> reference to rescale the chart, just as you can with Draw files.
    </p>
    <p>You can copy the chart into more than one document.</p>
    <p>
        To save a &lsquo;dead&rsquo; Draw file into a PipeDream document, proceed as above,
        sliding off the <span class="csg-menu-option">Draw file</span> option in the
        <span class="csg-menu">Save</span> sub-menu.
    </p>
    <p>You can also save the chart as a &lsquo;dead&rsquo; Draw file into a file or into another application such as Draw.</p>
    <p>To save a chart as a file to disc, drag its file icon into the required directory display.</p>
