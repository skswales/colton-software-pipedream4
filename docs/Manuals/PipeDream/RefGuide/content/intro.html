    <h1 id="About">About this Reference Guide</h1>
    <p>This reference guide is designed for users of PipeDream who know what they want to do but need to be able to look up the details.</p>
    <p>
        This guide is divided into topics which are arranged in alphabetical order.
        Each topic can be read by itself or in conjunction with related topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are a new user of PipeDream, look through the table of contents for those topics graded Level 1.
        These provide information about PipeDream which is useful for all users.
        Once you are more familiar with PipeDream, you might find the Level 2 topics interesting.
        Level 3 topics are really only for those with a specialised interest in the topic.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are unsure where to find the information you need, try looking up key words in the
        <a href="fullindex.html">index</a> or scanning the
        <a href="../index.html">table of contents</a> for related topics.
    </p>
    <p>At the beginning of this guide is a list of all the PipeDream commands with a reference to the topic you need to read for a detailed description of the command.</p>
