    <h1 id="Printer">Printer Drivers</h1>
    <p>There are two ways of printing your PipeDream document. The method you choose depends upon:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the type of printer you have</li>
        <li>whether you want to print pictures within your text</li>
        <li>whether you want to have different fonts within your text</li>
        <li>the speed of printing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both methods use a printer driver which you can think of as acting as an interpreter between your document as it appears on the screen and your document when printed.</p>
    <p>
        You can either use a PipeDream printer driver or a RISC&nbsp;OS printer driver.
        The fundamental difference between the two is that PipeDream printer drivers are text-oriented
        whereas RISC&nbsp;OS printer drivers are graphics-oriented, i.e. they build up a graphic picture of your document in tiny dots and then print those dots.
        This means that the fonts you can produce are completely independent of the printer&rsquo;s built-in typefaces.
        They are defined by what is available in the RISC&nbsp;OS computer.
    </p>

    <h4 id="RISC">RISC&nbsp;OS printer drivers</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>are graphics-oriented;</li>
        <li>print quickly on PostScript and PCL laser and inkjet printers, slowly on dot-matrix printers and not at all on daisywheel printers;</li>
        <li>can print pictures from PipeDream;</li>
        <li>can print the grid;</li>
        <li>can print using any of the RISC&nbsp;OS fonts available to you either as a global font or as a local font change (@F@);</li>
        <li>can print both portrait (vertically) and landscape (horizontally).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="PipeDream">PipeDream printer drivers</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>are text-oriented;</li>
        <li>can send highlight codes to the printer to exploit its special facilities;</li>
        <li>print as quickly as the printer will allow on all types of printer;</li>
        <li>cannot generate PostScript or other page description languages;</li>
        <li>cannot print pictures from PipeDream;</li>
        <li>cannot print the grid;</li>
        <li>cannot print using either the global font or any local font changes (@F@).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Highlight characters are treated differently.
        PipeDream printer drivers contain fields in which you type sequences of codes to perform operations such as
        underlining, bold, italics, superscripts and subscripts and, to a limited extent, font changes.
        These font changes are produced by the printer, using the different typestyles it has available;
        they are nothing to do with the fonts that RISC&nbsp;OS has available.
        The RISC&nbsp;OS printer drivers differ in that, if you want to print in bold or italic,
        there must be a bold or italic version of the font available on your RISC&nbsp;OS computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may seem confusing to have two different ways of printing but in fact PipeDream is giving you the best of both worlds.
        In practice, you will probably find that one method suits your set-up and needs and stick to that method.
        If you have a laser or inkjet printer, you will probably use an appropriate RISC&nbsp;OS printer driver.
        If you have a daisywheel printer, the choice is easy - use the PipeDream printer driver called
        <span class="csg-filename">Daisywheel</span> provided in the PipeDream Examples.
        If you have a dot-matrix printer, you can use either type of printer driver:
        use RISC&nbsp;OS if you want to print pictures within your text or to have different fonts or sizes,
        or PipeDream if you want to print quickly and need no more than simple highlights such as underline or bold.
