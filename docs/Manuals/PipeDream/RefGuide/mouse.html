<h1>Mouse Techniques</h1>

<p>The following is a summary of mouse operations which apply to a PipeDream
window.</p>

<h2>Positioning the Caret</h2>

<p>Moving the pointer onto a row and clicking Select usually positions the
caret in the cell containing the pointer. However, if that cell is blank, and
there is a text cell to the left which can overlap the blank cell, PipeDream
puts the caret in the text cell. This is to prevent you from accidentally
typing text into two different columns on the same row. If you really want the
caret to be in the blank cell into which you moved the pointer, hold down Ctrl
and click Select.</p>

<p>Alternatively, click Select on the heading of the column and PipeDream will
move the caret along the row into that column.</p>

<h2>Loading Documents</h2>

<p>To load a PipeDream document, either double-click on its icon in a directory
viewer, or drag its icon from a directory viewer (or other running application)
onto the PipeDream icon on the icon bar.</p>

<h2>Inserting Documents</h2>

<p>Drag a file's icon from a directory viewer (or other running application)
into a window to insert the file at the caret position.</p>

<h2>Opening A PipeDream Window</h2>

<p>To open a new PipeDream window, click Select on the PipeDream icon on the
icon bar.</p>

<p>To open a new document with a different template:</p>

<p>1. Click Menu on the PipeDream icon on the icon bar.</p>

<p>2. Slide across the <span class="csguide-menu-option">New document</span> option
to bring up the <span class="csguide-dbox">Load template</span> dialogue
box.</p>

<p>3. Click on the arrows to find the template file you want and click the
<span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<h2>Bringing up Menus and Choosing Commands</h2>

<p>With the pointer in a PipeDream window, click Menu to bring up the top level
menu.</p>

<p>To bring up a sub-menu, slide the pointer over the arrow to the right of the
menu name.</p>

<p>To choose a command, click Select on the command name. This carries out the
command and removes the menu from the screen. If you click Adjust, the menu
remains on the screen.</p>

<p>To repeat the last command, use the <span class="csguide-command">Repeat
Command</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Files</td>
      <td>Repeat command</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">J</span></td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">F5</span></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This enables you to repeat commands easily without having the menu in the
way or having to type long Ctrl-key sequences.</p>

<h2>Putting Cell References Into the Formula Line</h2>

<p>To put a cell reference into the formula line or formula window whilst you
are editing a formula, click Select in the cell to which you want to refer. The
cell can be in the current window or in another window.</p>

<p>By default, relative cell references will be inserted. To fix the row part
of the reference, hold down the SHIFT key when you click on the cell. To fix
the column part of the reference, hold down the Ctrl key when you click on the
cell. PipeDream will add $ signs to fix the reference.</p>

<p>To insert a range in the formula line or formula window you can either click
Select at the start and the end of the range, or you can drag from the start to
the end of the range.</p>

<h2>Using Scroll Bars</h2>

<p>To scroll one line in the direction of the arrow, position the pointer on
the scroll arrow and click Select. Hold down Select to continue scrolling.
Click Adjust to scroll back the other way. The caret always remains within the
PipeDream window, staying as near as possible to its original position.</p>

<p>To scroll windowful by windowful, position the pointer on the darker part of
the scroll bar (above the slider to scroll up, below the slider to scroll down)
and click Select. The next windowful of the document will appear. Click Adjust
to scroll back the other way. The caret always remains within the PipeDream
window, moving, if necessary to the point nearest to its position before
scrolling.</p>

<p>To move down through the document, position the pointer on the slider, press
Select and hold it down. Drag the slider to display the part of the document
you want to see.</p>

<p>To move from one side of a document to the other, use the horizontal scroll
bars. The caret always remains within the PipeDream window, staying as near as
possible to its original position.</p>
