<h1>ASCII and Paragraph File Formats</h1>

<p>Passing data between applications is an inexact science - don't believe
those who pretend otherwise!</p>

<p>Any productivity package which has anything unique to offer will almost
certainly have its own unique data format to encapsulate the information it
needs in its files. It is difficult for one application to read the data
formats of other applications because of these different data structures. As a
result, most applications provide facilities to save out a subset of
information so that another application can import it.</p>

<p>PipeDream provides two file formats to help transfer text to and from other
word processors and desktop publishing (DTP) packages. These are ASCII format
and paragraph format. They are very simple and differ from each other in only
one respect.</p>

<h2>Saving in ASCII and Paragraph Format</h2>

<p>Text is saved as plain text without any font style information. The only
page layout information provided is <code>TAB</code> characters which separate
columns. No formulae from number cells are saved; instead the current value of
each cell is saved. Display formats are also saved so that if you are loading
the file into a DTP package, you will get leading and trailing characters,
thousands format and your brackets settings. If the data is to be loaded back
into PipeDream, you may prefer to change the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Options</span> dialogue box settings so that only plain
numbers are printed. Then, when you have reloaded the file, you will be able to
use the <span class="csguide-command">Number&lt;&gt;Text</span> command
(<span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-BNT</span>) to convert the numbers back into numeric cells. The
settings you need in the <span class="csguide-dbox">Options</span> dialogue
box are:</p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">Negative numbers</span>: Minus</p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">Thousands separator</span>: none</p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">Leading characters</span>: blank</p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">Trailing characters</span>: blank</p>

<p>With ASCII format, PipeDream saves a line separator at the end of each line.
You can specify the line separator in the <span
class="csguide-dbox">Save</span> dialogue box. To save to other RISC OS
applications, it is usually best to use a linefeed (<code>LF</code>). For BBC
Micro applications, use a carriage return (<code>CR</code>). For Windows
applications, use <code>CR-LF</code>.</p>

<p>With Paragraph format, PipeDream puts a separator at the end of each
paragraph. This is the format that DTP packages and many more recently written
word processors use. In particular, you will probably find paragraph format the
best for saving to Impression and Ovation.</p>

<h2>Loading in ASCII and Paragraph Format</h2>

<p>PipeDream 4 can also load files in both of these formats. To load an ASCII
or paragraph format file into PipeDream, simply drag its icon to the PipeDream
icon on the icon bar. PipeDream will automatically determine what the format is
and load the file appropriately.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it isn't easy to tell the difference automatically between ASCII
and paragraph format files because the formats are so similar. If you find that
PipeDream has made the wrong guess, reload the file forcing the correct format.
To do this, bring up the <span class="csguide-dbox">Load</span> dialogue box
with the <span class="csguide-command">Load</span> command
(<code>Ctrl-FL</code>). You will see that PipeDream has retained the filename
of the last file loaded; this is the file you want to reload. Choose
the correct file format at the bottom of the dialogue box and then click
the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>. PipeDream will load the file in the
correct format.</p>
