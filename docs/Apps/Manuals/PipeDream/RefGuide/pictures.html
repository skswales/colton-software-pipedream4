<h1>Pictures</h1>

<p>Pictures created in RISC OS Draw or Paint programs and stored as Draw files
on your computer can be inserted into a PipeDream document.</p>

<p>1. Move the caret to the bottom of the paragraph below which you want the
picture to appear.</p>

<p>2. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Insert Row</span> command
repeatedly to insert sufficient space for your picture.</p>

<p>It is very important that you leave plenty of space for your picture as,
when you insert it, it will be displayed over anything below or to the right of
the space you have allowed for it, if that space is not big enough. It is
better to leave too much space than not to have enough.</p>

<p>3. Ensure that the caret is in the slot at the top-left of where you want
the picture positioned. Bring onto the screen the directory viewer containing
the picture. Drag the picture's icon into the window. PipeDream will load the
picture and position it at the caret.</p>

<p>PipeDream does not in fact store the picture within the PipeDream document
but simply inserts a reference to the file in the form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><code>@G:filename,100@</code></p>

<p>Because of this, you need only one copy of the picture on the disc, not one
for each document.</p>

<p>The number at the end indicates the percentage scale factor at which the
picture is to be drawn. You can change this to other values to resize the
picture.</p>

<p>It is best to drag the picture to the document from the same directory as
the document was loaded. If you do this, PipeDream stores just the leafname
(and not the whole directory path) of the picture. If the directories are
different, PipeDream has to store the whole directory path. Storing just the
leafname is advantageous because the two files can be copied into other
directories or onto other discs and PipeDream will look for the file in the new
directory rather than the original one.</p>

<p>Alternatively, proceed as follows:</p>

<p>4. Type in <span class="csguide-key">@G:<em>filename</em>@</span> where <em>filename</em> is the name of
the file containing a picture you have created in a draw or paint program and
want to insert at this point.</p>

<p>By default, PipeDream looks for the picture file in the same directory as
the file you are editing. It is, therefore, a good idea to keep pictures and
text for the same document in the same directory.</p>

<p>5. Press <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> and you will see that the
picture has been inserted.</p>

<p>If necessary, delete any blank rows between the picture and the paragraph
beneath it by positioning the caret on the blank row immediately below the
picture and giving the <span class="csguide-command">Delete Row</span>
command.</p>

<p>Note that when the slot containing the picture is not on the screen, no part
of the picture is shown.</p>
