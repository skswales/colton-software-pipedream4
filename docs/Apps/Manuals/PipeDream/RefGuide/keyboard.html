<h1>Keyboard Definition</h1>

<p>If you often need to type the same word or number into a document, you can
set it up on a key so that you can enter it with a single key press. You can
likewise set up a frequently used sequence of commands as a single key
press.</p>

<h2>To Define a Text Sequence</h2>

<p>1. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Define Key</span> command:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Caret</td>
      <td>Define key</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">CDK</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>2. Click Select on the arrow icons until the key to which you want to assign
the text appears in the right-hand box. The number in the left-hand box is the
ASCII value of the key.</p>

<p>3. Type in the text string you want the key to produce.</p>

<p>4. Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>If you set the <span class="csguide-option">Key to define</span> option to <code>121 y</code> and the <span class="csguide-option">Definition</span> option to <code>PipeDream</code>, then every time you press the <span class="csguide-key">y</span> key the word <span class="csguide-sample">PipeDream</span> will be inserted into the current document.</p>

<p>To set the <span class="csguide-key">y</span> key back to its original function:</p>

<p>1. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Define Key</span> command.</p>

<p>2. Set the <span class="csguide-option">Key to define</span> option to
<code>121 y</code>.</p>

<p>3. Leave the <span class="csguide-option">Definition</span> option
blank.</p>

<p>4. Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<h2>To Define a Command Sequence</h2>

<p>A command sequence is defined in exactly the same way, by listing what you
would type to issue the commands.</p>

<p>The differences are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>\</code> is used to represent the Ctrl-key. To split a line, for
    example, you would type <code>\ESL|M</code> .</li>
  <li>You must type <code>|M</code> after each command.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to include the <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> key in a sequence you should
enter it as <code>\CEN|M</code> .</p>

<p>For example, if you set the <span class="csguide-option">Definition</span>
option to <code>PipeDream\CEN|Mby Colton Software</code>, when you press the
<span class="csguide-key">y</span> key now, the following will appear on the screen:</p>

<div class="csguide-sample" style="margin-left:2em;">
<p>PipeDream</p>
<p>by Colton Software</p>
</div>

<p><code>CEN</code> is the Ctrl-key sequence which is generated when the
<span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> key is pressed.</p>

<p>You can find the Ctrl-key sequences for other caret movements in this Reference
Guide. All other sequences appear on the menus, some on long menus only.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><code>\ESL|M\CEN|M</code></p>

<p>splits the line before doing a carriage return.</p>

<h2>To Redefine a Function Key</h2>

<p>The <span class="csguide-command">Define Function Key</span> command enables you to redefine the effect of the function keys <span class="csguide-key">F1</span> to <span class="csguide-key">F12</span>, with <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-F<span class="csguide-arg">n</span></span>,
<span class="csguide-key">Shift-F<span class="csguide-arg">n</span></span> and
<span class="csguide-key">Shift-Ctrl-F<span class="csguide-arg">n</span></span> variants. So, if
you prefer a different function key layout, you can define your own.</p>

<p>As a simple example, give the <span class="csguide-command">Define Function
Key</span> command. You will see the <span class="csguide-option">Function key
to define</span> option in the dialogue box. Use this option to determine which
function key you want to redefine. Click Select on the up arrow icon. PipeDream
displays a list of the function keys <code>F1</code> to <code>F12</code>, then
<code>Shift-F1</code> to <code>Shift-F12</code>, then <code>Ctrl-F1</code> to
<code>Ctrl-F12</code>, and finally <code>Shift-Ctrl-F1</code> to
<code>Shift-Ctrl-F12</code>. Release the Select button when PipeDream gets to
<code>Shift-Ctrl-F1</code>. If you overshoot, do not worry; simply click Select
on the down arrow icon until you get back to it.</p>

<h4>Entering Strings</h4>

<p>The <span class="csguide-option">Definition</span> option is where you
specify what you want PipeDream to do when you press
<span class="csguide-key">Shift-Ctrl-F1</span>. Type in</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><code>The cat sat on the mat</code></p>

<p>and click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span>.</p>

<p>Now press <span class="csguide-key">Shift-Ctrl-F1</span>. You will see that PipeDream enters the
string just as if you had typed it at the keyboard.</p>

<h2>To Redefine a Ctrl-Key Sequence</h2>

<p>The <span class="csguide-command">Define Command</span> command enables you
to redefine the key sequences. It is only useful for those of you using foreign
language versions of PipeDream.</p>

<p>For example, if you want <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-Q</span> to perform an <span
class="csguide-command">Edit Formula</span> command (<span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-X</span>),
specify:</p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">Command to define</span> <code>X</code></p>

<p><span class="csguide-option">Define as</span> <code>Q</code></p>

<p>Now, when you press <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-Q</span>, the <span
class="csguide-command">Edit Formula</span> command is carried out.</p>

<p>Think carefully before redefining the Ctrl-key sequences in this way.</p>

<p>Remember that PipeDream uses the letters F, E, L, P, B, C and S as the first
character of multiple key commands and so if you redefine any of these, you
will be affecting a lot of commands. Note that redefining keys in this way does
not affect the backslash sequences in command files or keyboard redefinition.
Neither do the redefined sequences appear on menus.</p>

<h2>Foreign Characters</h2>

<p>As well as using keyboard redefinition to enable you to enter common
strings, you can also use it to configure your keyboard for foreign character
sets, although you will probably prefer to use the international keyboard
modules.</p>

<p>As an example, redefine the character <code>#</code> to the produce the
character <code>&cent;</code>. Give the <span class="csguide-command">Define
Key</span> command. On the <span class="csguide-option">Key to define</span>
line, click Select on the down arrow icon until PipeDream displays <code>35
#</code>. Set the <span class="csguide-option">Definition</span> option to
<code>&cent;</code> by holding down the <span
class="csguide-key">Alt</span> key whilst you type 162
(the value for &cent; in the Latin1 font encoding) on the numeric keypad.
You should see <code>&cent;</code> appear in the Definition field. Click the <span
class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span> to confirm the definition. Now press the
<span class="csguide-key">#</span> key and PipeDream will enter &cent; in the current slot.
You may find it convenient to use the <strong>!Chars<strong> application.
For the numerical values for particular characters consult your RISC OS User Guide.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>As well as redefining keys to produce strings or other characters, you can
also redefine keys to perform PipeDream commands.</p>

<p>Imagine that you want to delete every alternate line in a file which is a
thousand lines long. One way to do this is to move to every alternate line and
delete it by pressing and giving the <span class="csguide-command">Delete
Row</span> command repeatedly. But you would probably get rather tired of doing
this after a while and start making mistakes, deleting the wrong lines. There
is a better way. Load a file from which you do not mind deleting a few lines.
Give the <span class="csguide-command">Define Function Key</span> command and
click Select on the arrow icons until the top line indicates
<code>Shift-Ctrl-F2</code>. Type the following on the <span
class="csguide-option">Definition</span> line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><code>\Y|M\CCD|M</code></p>

<p>Now click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button or press <span
class="csguide-key">Enter</span> to confirm the
definition. Move to a paragraph of text and insert a blank line between every
line in the paragraph. This will probably give you an idea of just how tedious
deleting 500 alternate lines would be. The definition we entered tells
PipeDream to perform a <span class="csguide-command">Delete Row</span> command
(<span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-Y</span>) followed by a <span class="csguide-command">Caret
Down</span> command (<span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-CCD</span>).</p>

<p>Check this by looking at the <span class="csguide-menu">Edit</span> menu and this Reference Guide.
This Reference Guide contains a list of all the command sequences which do not
appear anywhere on the long menus. Now move to the first blank line that you have just
inserted. Press <span class="csguide-key">Shift-Ctrl-F2</span> and you will see the line disappear
and the pointer move down. Press <span class="csguide-key">Shift-Ctrl-F2</span> again and this time
hold it down. You will see each blank line disappear. If you delete some text
by mistake, you may be able to recover these lines by defining another function
key to insert lines and paste.</p>

<h2>Clearing Definitions</h2>

<p>To redefine a key to its original definition, simply define the key with a
blank definition string, or one composed entirely of spaces.</p>
