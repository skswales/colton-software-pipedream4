<h1>Recalculation</h1>

<p>Recalculation ensures that the contents of number slots remain up to date at
all times. Every time you make a change to a slot, PipeDream recalculates all
other slots which depend upon it.</p>

<p>PipeDream 4 recalculates automatically unless you specify otherwise. With
PipeDream 4&apos;s advanced recalculation facilities, you should never need to
switch to manual recalculation. However, the option to do so exists. You can
switch off automatic recalculation by clicking on the <span
class="csguide-option">Auto recalc</span> option on the <span
class="csguide-menu">Choices</span> sub-menu to turn it off.
If you switch to manual recalculation, when you give the <span
class="csguide-command">Recalculate</span> command, PipeDream will recalculate
all those slots which have changed since the last recalculation. Switching
recalculation to manual applies to all documents in your computer.</p>

<p>PipeDream uses natural recalculation. This means that when you change a
value in the spreadsheet, or enter a new value, instead of recalculating the
whole spreadsheet, PipeDream recalculates only those slots which need to be
altered as a result of the change you have made. Therefore, only a small
section usually needs to be recalculated, and recalculation is completed
quickly. Natural recalculation also means that forward references are
automatically resolved; if you have forward references, you do not have to give
the Recalculate command several times to get the values to stabilise. With
natural recalculation, you cannot have circular or self-references. If you put
the formula A1+1 in slot A1, PipeDream will display the error <strong>Circular
reference</strong>.</p>

<h3>Background Recalculation</h3>

<p>PipeDream 4 recalculates in the background, ie when nothing else is going on
in the computer. This means that you can get on with something else either in
PipeDream or in another program whilst recalculation is going on. PipeDream
will carry on recalculating the spreadsheet whenever there is some time to do
so. Whilst PipeDream is recalculating, a number is shown in the mark block box
at the top left-hand side of the screen. This number represents the number of
slots PipeDream knows it has to recalculate. Due to the complexities of natural
recalculation, the number may go up during a recalculation if PipeDream finds
more slots needing recalculation, but generally it goes down until it reaches
zero.</p>

<h3>To Recalculate</h3>

<p>If you have chosen to use manual recalculation, you will need to gave the
<span class="csguide-command">Recalculate</span> command to recalculate your
spreadsheet:</p>

<table class="csguide-command-table">
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="csgcth-menu">Menu</th>
      <th class="csgcth-command">Command</th>
      <th class="csgcth-ctrl">Ctrl-sequence</th>
      <th class="csgcth-key">Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Files</td>
      <td>Recalculate</td>
      <td><span class="csguide-key">A</span></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>All slots in the document which need recalculating will be recalculated. The
hourglass may be displayed while PipeDream completes this operation if there
are many slots to recalculate.</p>
