<h1>Conventions</h1>

<p>Before you start to use PipeDream, you should be familiar with the
RISC&nbsp;OS desktop.</p>

<p>You should know how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>use the icons on the icon bar to run applications and open documents;</li>
  <li>use the mouse and pointer to position the caret and understand terms and
    techniques such as click, double-click and drag;</li>
  <li>scroll a window using the scroll bars;</li>
  <li>change the size and position of windows using the back icon, the toggle
    size icon, the adjust size icon and the title bar;</li>
  <li>close windows using the close icon;</li>
  <li>bring up menus and choose commands.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also understand terms such as dialogue box, directory and
directory viewer.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with any of the terms or techniques above,
please refer to your RISC&nbsp;OS User Guide.</p>

<h2>Using the Mouse</h2>

<p>The three mouse buttons are referred to as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select - Left mouse button;</li>
  <li>Menu - Middle mouse button;</li>
  <li>Adjust - Right mouse button.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pressing and releasing a mouse button is described as
<strong>clicking</strong>. Mouse buttons are usually referred to by name. For example,
click Menu means that you should press and release the Menu button. Click
Select means that you should press and release the Select button. Click
without any button name is shorthand for click Select.</p>

<p>Pressing and releasing a mouse button twice in quick succession is described
as <strong>double-clicking</strong>. Again, the mouse button is usually specified. For
example, double-click Adjust means that you should press and release the Adjust
button twice in quick succession without moving the mouse. Double-click
without any button name is shorthand for double-click Select.</p>

<p>Pressing and holding down a mouse button while you move the mouse is
described as <strong>dragging</strong>. Once again, the mouse button is
specified. Drag Select means that you should press and hold down the Select
button while moving the mouse.</p>

<h2>The Pointer and the Caret</h2>

<p>It is very important that you understand clearly the distinction between
these two features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pointer - An arrow-shaped icon that moves as you move the mouse.
    Generally, the pointer has no effect until you click a mouse button.</li>
  <li>Caret - A red <span class="csguide-greek-symbol">I</span>-shaped icon (<img src="images/caret.png" />) that shows
    where the next character you type will appear.</li>
</ul>

<p>To position the caret, you use the mouse to move the pointer to the required
position and click the Select button.</p>

<h2>Keys</h2>

<p>When you are asked to press a single key on the keyboard, it will be
expressed as follows:</p>

<p>Press <span class="csguide-key">A</span>.</p>

<p>This means that you should press and release the key which has the letter
&apos;A&apos; on it.</p>

<p>Some keys can appear to be ambiguous. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>O</code> is the letter &apos;oh&apos;, whereas <code>0</code> is the figure
    zero. On some RISC&nbsp;OS systems, zero may be shown on the keyboard as 0 with a
    slash through it.</li>
  <li><code>l</code> is the lower case letter &apos;el&apos;, whereas <code>1</code> is
    the figure one.</li>
  <li><code>x</code> means that you should press and release the letter &apos;ex&apos;,
    whereas <code>*</code> is what you use to express multiplication.</li>
  <li><code>|</code> is used to represent the character which appears as a
    broken vertical bar on some keyboards and a solid vertical bar on the
    screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are asked to press one of the keys on the keyboard which has a word
written on it, this will be expressed as follows:</p>

<p>Press <span class="csguide-key">Esc</span>.</p>

<p>This means that you should press and release the key which has &apos;Esc&apos; written
on it.</p>

<p>Note the following:</p>

<p><span class="csguide-key">&crarr;</span> refers to the key on the right-hand
side of the main keyboard which is usually used to complete an operation. You
may know this key either as <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> or
<span class="csguide-key">Return</span>.</p>

<p>Pressing the <span class="csguide-key">Backspace</span> or
<span class="csguide-key">&#x21a4;</span> key deletes anything to the left of the
caret. You can also use the <span class="csguide-key">Delete</span> key.</p>

<p>The <span class="csguide-key">Alt</span> key is found on the left-hand and
right-hand sides of the keyboard, and is used to generate characters which do
not appear on the keyboard, such as &eacute;.</p>

<p>The <span class="csguide-key">Esc</span> key can usually be used to abandon an
operation. It is sometimes known as the &apos;ESCAPE&apos; key.</p>

<p>Note that the <span class="csguide-key">End</span> key may also have &apos;Copy&apos;
written on it. In PipeDream, this key is generally used to move to the bottom
of a column.</p>

<p>The <span class="csguide-key">&larr; &uarr; &rarr; &darr;</span> keys are the
arrow or caret keys which you can use to move the caret about the document as
an alternative to using the mouse.</p>

<p><span class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span> and <span class="csguide-key">Shift</span>
are held down simultaneously with other keys to modify their effect.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Press <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-O</span> means:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hold down <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span> .</li>
  <li>Press and release <span class="csguide-key">O</span> .</li>
  <li>Release <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span> .</li>
</ol>

<p>Anything that you type is shown in a computer typeface.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Type <span class="csguide-key">lesson &crarr;</span> means that you should type the word
&apos;lesson&apos; and then press the <span class="csguide-key">Enter</span> key.</p>

<p>Words shown in italics are not to be typed in literally, but indicate that
you should substitute what the word represents.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><code>&nbsp;<em>filename</em></code></p>

<p>would represent the name of your file.</p>
