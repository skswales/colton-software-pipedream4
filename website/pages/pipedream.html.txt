<h2>What is PipeDream 4?</h2>

PipeDream 4 can be used for word processing: to create letters, reports, invitations, film scripts and books. You can also use PipeDream 4 as a spreadsheet: to create ledgers, simple shopping lists, complex scientific models and cash flow forecasts. You can even use PipeDream 4 as a database for storing parts lists, names and addresses, details of personal collections and mark sheets.

PipeDream 4 can help you do things that would be very difficult or impossible with other programs. For example:

<ul>
    <li>Include live calculations in your word processing;</li>
    <li>Annotate your spreadsheets with formattable paragraphs of text;</li>
    <li>Write a letter in your word processor and send it to a selection of people from your names and addresses database;</li>
    <li>Check the spelling of your spreadsheet;</li>
    <li>Sort into alphabetical order the list that you have just typed into your word processor;</li>
    <li>Create a new field containing calculations in your database and sort on it;</li>
    <li>Create live charts from data in your spreadsheets and databases and include the charts in your reports.</li>
</ul>
