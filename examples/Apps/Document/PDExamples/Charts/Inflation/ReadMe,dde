%C%%H2%Inflation chart

This chart is an %H4%overlay%H4% chart.  Overlays are mixed charts and they are usually a mixture of bar and 
line charts.  In this case the bars represent unemployment figures and the line the inflation rate.  
Notice that the two series each have their own axes.

Put the chart into an editing window by selecting Edit Chart from the Charts menu.  Then type the real 
numbers in the relevant slots.

Try changing one of the inflation figures to 12%PC%.  To do this just enter 12 into one of the slots; don't 
type the %PC%.  Watch the chart change and notice the inflation label change.  See if you can work out 
from the spreadsheet how this has been created from the chart.
