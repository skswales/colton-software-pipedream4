%C%%H2%Penguin Graphics

This file gives an exercise in creating Penguin Graphics.  It is 
best done in a wide screen mode.

1. Mark the slots from A1 to B4 by dragging with the mouse.

2. Bring up the PipeDream menu and, from the Chart 
sub-menu, select new chart.  This will give you a 3-D bar 
chart.

You may find that the chart window overlaps with this window.  
If so, move it as far to the right of the screen as you can.  You 
can also try making the chart window a little narrower.

3. With the pointer in the Chart window, bring up the Chart 
window menu, and select the Bar Gallery from the Gallery 
sub-menu.

%H2%Stretched penguins

4. In the Bar Gallery switch off 3-D by clicking on the check 
box. Then click on the icon showing the three penguins of 
different sizes.  This will select the "stretched" penguin chart.  
Then click on the OK button to clear the Bar Gallery.

5. Try changing the numbers in the slots above to see the 
penguins change size automatically.  For example try 
changing the Daddy size to 5.

%H2%Stacked penguins

6. Bring the Bar Gallery back onto the screen and click on the 
icon showing "stacked penguins" and then click on OK.  



%H2%Other pictures in penguin charts

7. Find the directory Pictures.Flags and bring up a directory 
viewer of it.

8. Click on one of the penguins in the chart with the left 
button.  This will select Series 1 which is all three penguin 
bars.  Drag the file UnionJack from the directory viewer into 
the chart window.  The penguin bars will change to stacked 
union jacks.

9. Click on one of the union jacks with the right button of the 
mouse.  this will select just that data point.  Drag another flag 
file into the chart.  The data point will be redrawn with the new 
flag.

10. Try changing the numbers at the top of this window.  Try 
also changing the labels.  For example, you might change 
"Daddy" to "Britain", "Mummy" to "USA" and "Baby" to 
"Japan".  Fill the bars with the appropriate flags.
