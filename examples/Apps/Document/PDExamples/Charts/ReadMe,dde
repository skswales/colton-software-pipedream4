%H2%Charts in PipeDream 4

This directory contains some sample charts and some simple tutorials showing you how to create your 
own charts.  The file %H4%charts%H4% contains some general information; read this first.  The directories Election, 
Inflation and Worldcup contain simple spreadsheets with live charts. The directories 1_3Dbars and 
2_Penguins give instructions on making your own charts.  Pictures contains some draw files which you 
can use in making your own charts.  If you like, you can also use your own draw files.

You may find that when investigating charts it is best to use a wide screen mode

Finally, fonts.  The charts in this directory use Trinity and Homerton outline fonts.  If you have these 
fonts available, all well and good.  If you do not have outline fonts the charts will be displayed with 
system font.  System font is rather ugly when used in graphics.  If you have this, please remember that 
charts are much prettier when using outline fonts.
