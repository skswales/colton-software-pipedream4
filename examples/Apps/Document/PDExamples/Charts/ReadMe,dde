%H2%Charts in demonstration PipeDream 4

This directory contains some sample charts and some simple tutorials showing you how to create your 
own charts.  The file %H4%charts%H4% contains some general information; read this first.  The directories Election, 
Inflation and Worldcup contain simple spreadsheets with live charts. The directories 1_3Dbars and 
2_Penguins give instructions on making your own charts.  Pictures contains some draw files which you 
can use in making your own charts.  If you like, you can also use your own draw files.

Remember that the demonstration version cannot save charts and so the charts that appear in the 
documents will not be updated dynamically as they would be if loaded into the real PipeDream.  You 
can, however, see the charts live by bringing up the PipeDream menu and selecting Edit Chart from 
the Charts menu.  This will put the chart into an edit window.  When you change the values in the 
spreadsheet the chart will redraw in the editing window.  You can also change the format of the chart 
in the editing window.

You may find that when investigating charts it is best to use a wide screen mode.  If you have an 
A5000 computer and a multi-sync monitor try mode 39.  If you have an earlier computer try mode 16.  
To change the screen mode, bring up the menu on the coloured palette icon at the bottom-left of the 
window, slide across the mode arrow and type the number in at the bottom of the menu.

Finally, fonts.  The charts in this directory use Trinity and Homerton outline fonts.  If you have these 
fonts available, all well and good.  If you do not have outline fonts the charts will be displayed with 
system font.  System font is rather ugly when used in graphics.  If you have this, please remember that 
charts are much prettier when using outline fonts.
