%C%%H2%Charts in PipeDream 4

This directory contains some sample charts and some simple tutorials showing you 
how to create your own charts.  The file %H4%charts%H4% contains some general information; 
read this first.  The directories Election, Inflation and Worldcup contain simple 
spreadsheets with live charts. The directories 1_3Dbars and 2_Penguins give 
instructions on making your own charts.  Pictures contains some draw files which you 
can use in making your own charts.  If you like, you can also use your own draw files.

You may find that when investigating charts it is best to use a wide screen mode

Finally, fonts.  The charts in this directory use Trinity and Homerton outline fonts.  If 
you have these fonts available, all well and good.  If you do not have outline fonts the 
charts will be displayed with system font.  System font is rather ugly when used in 
graphics.  If you have this, please remember that charts are much prettier when using 
outline fonts.
