%CO:A,12,72%%C%%H2%PipeDream features

This is a list of features in PipeDream which are not documented in the
%H4%Getting Started Guide%H4% or %H4%Reference Guide%H4%:

%H2%1. Absolute cell references

When editing a formula in the formula line or formula window you can insert absolute 
cell references in the formula by pressing the Shift and Ctrl keys whilst clicking the 
Select button on the mouse.  Pressing the Shift key puts a dollar sign before the row 
number, pressing the Ctrl key puts a dollar sign before the column letter.

%H2%2. Auto entry

When editing in the formula line pressing the up or down keys will enter the formula 
and the . then move the caret up or down.  Pressing TAB or Shift-TAB will enter the 
formula and then move the caret forward or backward a column.

%H2%3. Cell value on function menu

If you click on the function menu button (curly f at the top of the screen), a new entry 
has appeared on the menu: 'Cell value'.

Clicking on the function menu button gives you information on the current cell. It does 
different things if you are on number cells and text cells: on a text cell, if you have a 
formula which PipeDream persists in thinking is text, you will get the entry 
'Compile/Show error' off to the right. Click on this and PipeDream will tell you the 
reason that it thinks it's a text cell rather than a number cell.

If you click on the function menu button whilst on a number cell, PipeDream will give 
you another menu, listing cells, ranges and names. This mechanism is so you can 
follow the structure of a spreadsheet: you can look at supporting cells (those cells 
that this cell refers to) and dependent cells (those cells that refer to this cell). The 
values of these cells are given too, so if, for example, you get the message 
'Propagated' in a cell examining the values of the cell's supporters (and possibly the 
supporters of the supporters) you will get to the original source of the error.

If you click on the entry for a supporting or dependent cell, PipeDream will position 
the caret in that cell so you can follow the structure.

%H2%4. Formulae in arrays

Contrary to page 13 of the %H4%Reference Guide%H4%, you can now include formulae in arrays. 
You can only do this when the array is itself inside a formula (as opposed to an array 
defined by a name). Note that arrays defined by a name cannot contain formulae or 
names or cell references or ranges. For example: {1+2,3+4,a1+6}.

%H2%5. Redefining keys

The command Define Function key (Ctrl CDF) has been extended to enable the 
redefinition of many of the darker grey keys around the keyboard. A popular 
redefinition may be to redefine the Copy/End key to perform a "delete right" 
command.  To do this press Ctrl-CDF and click on the arrows until Copy appears as 
the key to define.  Enter

\G|M

as the definition and press Return.  Pressing the Copy key will now delete the 
character to the right.

We have provided a command file !PipeDream.CmdFiles.CopyDelete which does the 
redefinition for you.  If you rename this command file as !PipeDream.key, or merge 
the file into !PipeDream.key if you have one, PipeDream will do the redefinition 
automatically when it starts up.
