%C%%H2%PipeDream 4 features

This is a list of features in PipeDream 4 which are not documented in the Tutorial or Reference Guide:

%H2%1. Absolute slot references

When editing a formula in the formula line or formula window you can insert absolute slot references in 
the formula by pressing the SHIFT and CTRL keys whilst clicking the Select button on the mouse.  
Pressing the SHIFT key puts a dollar sign before the row number, pressing the CTRL key puts a dollar 
sign before the column letter.

%H2%2. Auto entry

Auto entry is possible in PipeDream 4.01 and onwards.  When editing in the formula line pressing the 
up or down keys will enter the formula and the . then move the caret up or down.  Pressing TAB or 
SHIFT-TAB will enter the formula and then move the caret forward or backward a column.

%H2%3. Slot value on function menu

If you click on the function menu button (curly f at the top of the screen), a new entry has appeared on 
the menu: 'Slot value'.

Clicking on the function menu button gives you information on the current slot. It does different things if 
you are on number slots and text slots: on a text slot, if you have a formula which PipeDream persists 
in thinking is text, you will get the entry 'Compile/Show error' off to the right. Click on this and 
PipeDream will tell you the reason that it thinks it's a text slot rather than a number slot.

If you click on the function menu button whilst on a number slot, PipeDream will give you another 
menu, listing slots, ranges and names. This mechanism is so you can follow the structure of a 
spreadsheet: you can look at supporting slots (those slots that this slot refers to) and dependent slots 
(those slots that refer to this slot). The values of these slots are given too, so if, for example, you get 
the message 'Propagated' in a slot examining the values of the slot's supporters (and possibly the 
supporters of the supporters) you will get to the original source of the error.

If you click on the entry for a supporting or dependent slot, PipeDream will position the caret in that slot 
so you can follow the structure.

%H2%4. Formulae in arrays

Contrary to page 13 of the Reference Guide, you can now include formulae in arrays. You can only do 
this when the array is itself inside a formula (as opposed to an array defined by a name). Note that 
arrays defined by a name cannot contain formulae or names or slot references or ranges. For 
example: {1+2,3+4,a1+6}.

%H2%5. Redefining keys

The command Define Function key (Ctrl CDF) has been extended to enable the redefinition of many of 
the darker grey keys around the keyboard. A popular redefinition may be to redefine the Copy/End key 
to perform a "delete right" command.  To do this press Ctrl-CDF and click on the arrows until Copy 
appears as the key to define.  Enter

\G|M

as the definition and press Return.  Pressing the Copy key will now delete the character to the right.

We have provided a command file !PipeDream.CmdFiles.CopyDelete which does the redefinition for 
you.  If you rename this command file as !PipeDream.key, or merge the file into !PipeDream.key if you 
have one, PipeDream will do the redefinition automatically when it starts up.
